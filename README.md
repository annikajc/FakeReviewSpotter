# Fake Review Spotter
A web application that identifies fake reviews and returns true Amazon ratings.

## Running the Model
1. If not installed, install NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.
2. Create a virtual environment using the `requirements.txt` file. You may have to modify the version of CUDA
   in the requirements file to match the installed version from step 1.
3. To train, modify the train script to contain the desired hyperparameters and run `python train.py`.
