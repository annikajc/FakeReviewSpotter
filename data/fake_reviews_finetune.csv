Books_5,5,OR,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Double Fudge"". . . This book once again focuses on the book's main character Farley Drexel Hatcher (B.K.A. ""Fudge""). He is absolutely hilarious in this book. His obsession with money, his twin cousins and their little brother nicknamed ""Mini"", along with their parents are another interesting twist in this story. Peter Hatcher, Fudge's  older brother, who is now an official ""junior high school student"",  typically experiences all of the anxiety that is associated with  early adolesence.
This book made me laugh and laugh, especially the reaction of Mr. Hatcher when he discovers that their his cousins  want to stay at their house longer than a week.
I was also able to put myself in  many of the situations and generally grasp a feel each of the characters.
The first book that I ever read in the Fudge series was ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing"" followed by ""Superfudge"". I can remember attending Jefferson Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas waiting in line for what seemed like an infinity, to have first bid on checking out that book. I became a ""reader beaver"" thanks to Judy Blume and the wonderful staff at Jefferson Elementary who encouraged all students to build their foundation through reading. I used to walk swifly through the library with the rest of my classmates running straight towards the ""B"" fiction section --shouting, ""Ready or not here I come.""
This is an excellent read, and it is authors like Judy Blume who grasp the interest of young readers by  making her work interesting and identifiable to young readers. Thank you Ms. Judy Blume for providing great reading material for children of all ages!"
Books_5,4,OR,I understand this is the beginning of a new series. I will read the next book but the start is not as good as the Odd Thomas series.
Books_5,1,OR,"Up to now, the only things Bill O'Reilly have ever been good at are weak-minded thought manipulation and noise pollution, but now he has another box to tick off on his resume: he can write humor. Unintentional humor, that is. You see, the garbage that is ""The No-Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America"" proves that even on the page, Bill O'Reilly shines through as a complete hypocrite, and a horrible, horrible writer. It's so bad it's funny. Or it would be funny if people didn't actually listen to and believe this man.

You can see it in print as clearly as on his shows: this guy pulls words out of the mouths of the people he interviews; he bullies them with his stupid questions that are engineered to cater to his own views... And he is never after the truth, because the truth is a gray area and he only sees in black and white. Because he grew up rich and went to a boys' private Catholic school, he likes to think of himself as some kind of supreme arbiter over everyone. People like him are the reason many people think of the USA a ""bratty teenager of a country"". If you are looking for a book that is ""Fair and balanced"", this is most definitely not it. And really, I am not overly into politics, but I know that by supporting this travesty of a man and his pushy attitude the United States of America is sending the world the wrong kind of message."
Books_5,5,OR,"This book, if possible, is even better than the first book, The Passage.  I love the twists and turns and I can't put it down.  Can't wait to see what happens in the last book of this trilogy."
Books_5,3,OR,Interesting premise which moves fluidly thru place and time but almost too fluidly. The ending feels as if there was a deadline to meet. I give it a 6 out of 10
Books_5,5,OR,"This is by far my favorite version of Beauty and the Beast. I like that the family love one another instead of the usual not so loving family that frequently is written of.
I also adore that Beauty has her horse with her and that her passions are books and horses.
This is an incredibly well written book and I highly recommend this as an addition to your library of fantasy tales!"
Books_5,5,OR,"I absolutely adored those novel! ! Its amazing! !enticing'! Sexual!! And I love Gideon.& Eva!!
This story is definately better Imo than 50 shades since its being compared ...however
this writer knows.how to tell a story !!
I cannot wait for book 2 & this relationship makes sense! !
Five stars:::a stunning love story. With an amazing sex life to boot!!
I prefer this to 50 shades;-)!! Read it k lol"
Books_5,3,OR,"Macy is bored of all the pitiful looks she receives due to her fathers death a year earlier. She and her mother have been getting along fine, just fine, on their own. Her mother constantly works, and Macy helps her by sticking to their routine and keeping a perfectly clean house. Shes content with her perfect boyfriend and perfect grades and perfect life. That is, until a hectic catering company enlists her help at one of her mothers work parties. She then realizes how exciting chaos can be and how interesting real friends are. I read this book for my Read-a-Thon at school and I finished it in the day. It contains some serious issues, but overall its an airy read. The issues aren't heart-wrenching nor are they abnormal, so the book is easy to relate to. I could complain about its predictability or sappiness, but The Truth about Forever is defintely a book about the journey. It doesnt matter that the reader knows within the first chapter that Macy will fall for the gorgeous catering guy, Wes. Or that the book will have pages about finding yourself, realizing happiness, and moving on. I knew coming into the novel this wasn't a heavy book, which is why I enjoyed it. Its entertaining, and thats why I like Dessens books. Always, she writes books that serve to entertain and relate to teens. I flipped happily through the pages, never bored, but never thrilled either. The characters are fun and normal and don't have anything special about them. Her books are so realistic. The world isn't going to end and the characters don't have anything life altering happen to them. She somehow writes about ordinary days but still engages the reader wholeheartedly. The Truth about Forever is a cute romance between two teens trying to find themselves. The plot isn't extraordinary, but the writing style and characters really make the book. Compared to the other Dessen books Ive read, this one isn't as good, but I still found myself entertained while reading it. More book reviews at Stealingpages."
Books_5,2,OR,"Initially interesting and great insights but ends up being one more endless recount of the trashout days. By comparison, Keith Richards' ""Life"" has the breadth, scope and below-the-surface insight that writers should be targeting. I personally lived and drank and drugged my way thru the 60s and 70s. And still enjoy a good tale of those days. But ...."
Books_5,4,OR,"I was alit bit worried when i bought the book because their was so many bad reviews on here... but i have to say that iliked it.  I hate that everyone is trying compare it to Twilight.  I am one of the few people i know that didn't like twilight but loves vampire books.  Yes. there is a twist.  yes. i figured it out before they actually came out and told us, but i like the way that it was done. i think it makes the book different.  It is a fast read. nothing really deep about it but its a fun 'coming of age' vampire story"
Books_5,5,OR,"I LOVED THIS BOOK !
A GREAT STORY, SUCH STRENGTH SUCH A GOOD MAIN CHARACTER. BUT MOSTLY I LOVED IT BECAUSE OF THE TRUTH OF THE ORPHAN TRAIN STORY.
I ALSO GENEALOGY RESEARCH AND THIS JUST BLEW ME AWAY.
SO MANY FAMILY STORIES HAVE BEEN LOST BUT CAN BE FOUND.
GREAT BOOK I READ THE ENDING 3 TIMES
IF YOUR IRISH YOUWILL LOVE IT EVEN MORE"
Books_5,5,OR,"This is by far one of the best books ever written.  It follows a love story for a lifetime.  It does not say that all in life is perfect as long as there is love.  It lets life happen.  All the little details that we sometimes choose to ignore have consequences.  It proves that the heart wants what the heart wants.  Every emotion is thouroughly covered with honesty, dignity, joy and pain.  Everyone should read this book as well as A Hundred Years of Solitude by this author just for the beauty in the words.  I loved both of these books."
Books_5,5,OR,This series is AWESOME!!! I love this series and can't wait for each new installment. And the narration is excellent.
Books_5,5,OR,"All of Alexandra Day's Good Dog Carl books are wonderful books to share with children, but this one is my favorite."
Books_5,3,OR,"Have read all eight books and feel these people are a part of my family. I think the author wasted way too much time and detail on fillers in this book though while hurrying over the parts that the reader wanted. I won't spoil it for others by detailing my thoughts. Still glad I read it and will read number 9, if and when it's released."
Books_5,5,OR,I love this series.  This is the second time I'm reading it.  I found the characters of Richard and Kahlan were so well described that I actually found myself missing them - so decided to read the entire series again.
Books_5,4,OR,I enjoy this author and I particularly like the light hearted Chrstmas stories.  THey add to the happiness of Christmas and take one away from the bussel and hecticness of ones presnt duties.
Books_5,5,OR,I am in love with this series! I couldn't put this one down and thankfully I started it on a weekend so my work didn't get in the way! Ms Thayne did a wonderful job depicting a romance which blossomed from friendship. How refreshing to read a book not caught up in today's recipe of girl meets boy and has sex at the first opportunity. I can't wait for the next one!
Books_5,5,OR,"Year of the Unicorn is my favorite Witch World novel among the many five-star novels in this series by Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton (Alice Mary North).  Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey  the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.

The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were pack.

Year of the Unicorn is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Nortons Witch World. Unicorn veers away from the mainstream WW adventures of the Tregarth family (Witch World, Web of the Witch World, Three Against the Witch World, etc.), but it is perfect in its own setting (the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack), and in its own right."
Books_5,5,OR,"So I had been behind on this series.  Then I binged all of them over last summer.  So when this book came out - I was way more than ready.  Charley and Reyes, omg, right?  I'm really late on this review, but here I am.  Better late than never!

I'm terribly sad that this series is winding down.  I heard there is one more book, but I don't know.  I am hoping there is.  But even then, I don't think it would be enough.

The series in general involves all of the things that I love.  Supernatural things, a badass woman, and a sexy dark man.  And the humor is top notch.

I don't want to give spoilers away, but the big secrets just keep coming out.  I don't know how Charley and Reyes will get through everything.  And this book in particular had some really heartbreaking things happen.  Let's just say at the end, there were tears.  Big fat sloppy tears and I feel like a big part of the heart of it all in this world Darynda Jones created will be forever bruised.  And then, as per I've become accustomed, the story ends with a BANG! and I'm frantic to read the next one.

If you've made it to the 12th book in this series, there's nothing I need to tell you.  You know Darynda Jones can create a world and make it revolve like nobodies business.  If you haven't gotten to this book, then you definitely need to."
Books_5,4,OR,I always try to guess who or what and never get it right. Great reading.  Always enjoy Patterson.
Books_5,5,OR,I read both this book and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Both gave me insight into how others live in a different part of the world.  I had not seen the movie before I read the book.  I had to seek it out and see it once I finished the book.  Many should read these books that are so well written.  Historical yet riveting.
Books_5,4,OR,would have like to no if they got lucky at the end I've got dogs and I love them I'm very sick person my dogs are by my side all the time so this was close to my heart
Books_5,5,OR,"Had zero interest in the subject matter going in but loved the book, nonetheless. A great story, well-told."
Books_5,1,OR,"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:

P1: Everything that exists has a cause

Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:

P2: The universe exists.
-------------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)

But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.

This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!

For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:

P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence.
P2: The universe began to exist.
-----------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).

Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.

One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.

That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them."
Books_5,5,OR,"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft."
Books_5,4,OR,Each one in the series just gets better.  A wonderful  escape from the doom and gloom headlines of every day life.  Ladybug Farm is a seven book series and I already know I'll be suffering separation anxiety when I'm done with them all.  Off to the next one:)
Books_5,4,OR,"This book was enjoyable and an entertaining read.  It was nice in that the book engaged me and took my mind off of anything other than the book while I was reading it.  I chose this book after seeing the cover for the latest Maisie Dobbs story and liking the picture wanting to know more.  I decided to start with the first book in the series after reading reviews by other readers and a few professionals.

I enjoyed the transition from the curreny mystery back into Maisie's background to help develop her character which added some mystery itself.  The shift back to the mystery at the end tied everthing together nicely.

I am encouraging my wife to read the book and share it with her book club.  I will likely read more of the Maisie Dobbs series."
Books_5,3,OR,I'm looking forward to future novels about the young detective. This wasn't so bad. I thought it was too technical especially when it refer to history about sports greats. I would like more mystery in his future novels and less history. But the ending was great.
Books_5,4,OR,I enjoy his books predictable for fun.  I know I will enjoy the read.
Books_5,4,OR,"This might be my favorite celebrity memoir audiobook to date, simply because Martin Short is so freaking entertaining. On second thought, that's not the full reason why I loved this one...

While the narration performance was expectedly funny and entertaining (Short does a ton of impressions, including some of his most infamous charactersEd Grimley, Jiminy Glickas well as of his many celebrity friends, and he sings!), there were also some unexpectedly poignant and heart-wrenching moments captured too. Short spoke candidly about pretty much everything, and I have concluded that the man has the memory of an elephant because he was able to recall events and moments in his life dating back to his childhood with such pinpoint specificity, it was truly astonishing.

These read-by-the-author comedian celebrity memoirs have become my favorite things to listen to on audio. Even with the ridiculous name-dropping and chronology and details of things I don't remember or never even saw, I love how they give you both a performance and a real look inside the heart and soul of these entertainers.

If you are a casual fan of Martin Short, who I now feel like I know well enough to call ""Marty,"" treat yourself to I MUST SAY on audio. You won't regret it.

RATING: A-/B+ (4 stars)"
Books_5,5,OR,"Enjoyed this book immensely.  Count Rostov certainly exhibited ""an essential faith that by the smallest of one's actions one can restore some sense of order to the world"".  Considering his circumstances he did just that although it took decades."
Books_5,5,OR,"Since the first book of this series was written, I have kept up with each new novel. I love the stories about Angel Island... after falling in love with the people of Cape Light! Great books. Easy reads. Thought-provoking. Looking forward to the next book!"
Books_5,5,OR,"A wonderful book that led to a long conversation with my child.  Beautifully written and illustrated, the story tells a simple tale attacking materialism and promoting charity, that is perfectly written so as to turn to your childen and say, ""what was that story about.""  In a consumeristic age, and a culture where the relatives dump endless supplies of plastic stuff on the kids, this book sends a good counter message about the meaning of life."
Books_5,5,OR,"A remarkable life story by a remarkable woman.
Sotomayor tells of her life experiences in down-to-earth terms. It is a warm and wonderful book."
Books_5,4,OR,"This was a really enjoyable book. It sucked me in from the very beginning. I cared about the characters right away and wanted to know what was happening to them. The heartache and sorrow the characters felt. I know there are men out there who are very controlling of their girlfriend and spouse and this book shows a little bit of how one can be manipulated and cut off from their family. It is a pretty quick read because you will not want to put it down. I recommend this book and really enjoyed reading it. When it was done I wanted to know more about the characters. All the women in the book are strong women but they don't see it, the reader does."
Books_5,5,OR,excellent reading  and story.  Could not put the book down.
Books_5,3,OR,"On the off chance that like me you've read Big Chief Elizabeth and Samurai William (or at least one of them), it may be worth me stating that in my opinion this is the least impressive of the three. In agreement with the review below, Nathaniel's 'story occupies only a small part of this book', and it remains a trifle unconvincing that his 'endeavours were pivotal in the course of history'.

That being said, there are all the usual details - from tragic biographies to prolonged and agonising torture - to keep you turning the pages, and it is certainly interesting to read once again about how horrible those Dutch were to the poor English (as can also be read about in Samurai William). Then, of course, Milton is great at weaving a yarn together, and it is always fascinating to read about the exploits of various larger-than-life adventures; particularly those exploits centred on parts other than the 'spiceries' themselves. The book is a light and enjoyable read, but it is most certainly worth a read. Milton's greatest contribution to history is, I feel, his abilities to take a reader's imagination so convincingly back to a time of pirates and uncharted adventure."
Books_5,5,OR,Was a. really great book.very exciting .I never lost interest.the book keeps you guessing. I've read the series twice now and have enjoyed the books
Books_5,5,OR,"I LOVE THIS TOO!
I couldn't put it down.. I just read every time I had an opportunity!!!"
Books_5,5,OR,"You needn't be an historian, geologist or even American to be captivated by this insightful and entertaining examination of those movers and shakers of American history (well-known and unknown) who helped to guide it...and the world...through extraordinary accomplishments."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is part of Alistair Horne's four remarkable books about the military history of France from 1870 to 1962.

This  volume chronicles the collapse of the French army and government in 1940. No matter how powerful your army, lack of political will ends in defeat."
Books_5,5,OR,This years favorite book. I really wanted to understand life in Kentucky and the exodus to the midwest and the problems in the area after coal left so many people without jobs. This is an important book for Democrats to understand why people voted for Trump and a way to have more compassion for those coming from Coal country. I don't want to give more away but this shows the situation in a compassionate loving way about family and their strong bonds.
Books_5,5,OR,"Majorie Kinnan Rawlings had a great deal of talent, and did a *lot* of research for this book that takes place in 1871-1872.  She also was blessed with the most brilliant of editors, Max Perkins, who was an editor for 20th century literary giants like Fitzgerald and Hemingway.

It was Perkins who kept Rawlings on track with her novel, reminding her that the novel should not be just written 'for a boy' but also 'about a boy'.  He was the one who pointed out to her that her writing genius lay in stringing together episodes rather than hatching out intricate plots.  In addition, it was Perkins who reminded Rawlings that the setting was full of tough times and tough people & she should avoid the theatricality and romanticism that sometimes crept into early drafts of the novel and really strive to emphasize, even increase the naturalism.

 Finally, Perkins remained dissatisfied with Rawlings' early title: The Fawn.  He suggested that she find a more symbolic title.  When she came up with titles like The Flutter-Mill or Juniper Island, he held her to her task, saying that there was not enough human suggestion.  When she sent him a list including the eventual title, Perkins was satisfied that this was the right one.

Shortly after that, Rawlings decided what she'd written was inferior & threw it out.  Perkins prodded her to get going again.  This book IS a classic, Rawlings WAS talented, unbelievably so, but neither would be as true if it were not for the dedicated brilliance of Max Perkins.  Read THE YEARLING & also the excellent biography of Perkins by A. Scott Berg."
Books_5,5,OR,"wow, what we didn't know was going on during the cold war! Very good to finally know ""some"" of the history, amazing  ..."
Books_5,5,OR,"I didn't want to stop reading this to do anything else. It was that good. Just loved the author's voice and the characters - including the animals. The plot kept me guessing until the end. I usually can tell who the murderer was, but not with this one. And when I found out, it felt ""right.""

I used to love reading cozies, but then they began to feel so familiar, as if I'd read them before. Every once in a while, I'll still give a book that sounds interesting a try. It was wonderful to read this and feel that love again."
Books_5,5,OR,"Mr. Putter loves giving presents at Christmas time but although he starts planning in July it always takes him until December to decide what to give his neighbor and friend, Mrs. Teaberry. He knows that she likes salt shakers that walk, dresses for her teapots etc. What he can't believe is that she actually likes fruitcake! SO he decides that this Christmas she needs a ""light and airy cake"". Only one problem! Mr. Putter doesn't know how to bake a cake nor does he have any of the equipment.

Mr. Putter and Tabby, his cat, go to visit Mary Sue, the owner of the Sweet Shop. Mary Sue gladly helps him purchase all that he needs and so on Christmas Eve we see Mr. Putter baking the cake. How many times will it take him before he succeeds? What will Mrs. Teabody think of his gift? What happens on Christmas Day?

This is a delightful, well-written and beautifully illustrated book which is one of our young son's favorites. Just adorable! Highly recommended!"
Books_5,2,OR,"To complicated, need a medical degree to figure this out.  The other books are much better.  It is in no way and easy read."
Books_5,1,OR,This book was engaging until the last chapter. It was as if the author wrote the required number of pages and then just quit.  I would not waste my time on this book.
Books_5,2,OR,"I work as a senior DNA researcher. This book has an interesting topic, but is not up to date with current knowledge. E.g. in the nienties, people believed chromosomal ends - telomeres - were biological clocks. People believed that telomere length could be used to predict lifespan. Telomeres are huge parts of the junk DNA. The telomere theory was largely abandoned 5-6 years ago. If you know a fair bit about DNA, then this book is not for you. I know the DNA field is rapidly expanding, but somehow I anticipated a more modern book"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Bought this for my ""personal item"" instead of a laptop backpack for an upcoming European trip.  Have used it already to transport laptop and ipad.  Looking forward to using it.  Much more comfortable to carry than backpack.  Can wear it cross-body.  Distinctive color; great Pacsafe safety features.  So- since I've used it I can tell I'm going to love it, but I don't know exactly how great it will meet my needs until after I make the trip.  I think it's going to be great as my ""personal item"" on the plane.  I got the CS200 to carry around like a purse while there.  This would be way too huge to carry on daily walkabouts."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Amazing earrings especially for the price.  They are dainty but the color of the stones is good, the clasp is good.  I can't even believe they were an add on item!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I have to start woth I LOVE this dress. I was so scared when ordering this. Afraid it would be another onlinw order sizing fail or something but the second I opened it it all went away!  This dress is made very well. Does not look cheap one bit. The dress itself looked exactly like the picture and fit perfect. I loved the dress the second I put it on. I could go on forever. Im extremely happy with this purchase. I would definitely recomend this dress to anyone.
-I purchased this product at a discount/promotional Rate in exchange for my honest review."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"These are great!  Stitching was without an issue - and does what I needed it to do - keep my head from burning on long summer runs.

As an added bonus - I've found if I take my water bottle and pour it on my head - these stay wet for quite a while as well."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"I've purchased many washes of this size and cut, and I find that every pair fits me a little bit differently. This particular wash (""cast shadows"") is much looser than other washes I own, and they stretch out more throughout the day. (These jeans in ""soft black"" are my favorites."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Large Canvas Duffel

Purchased to store my 7.5' full Christmas tree with lights.  The bag worked well; handles are sturdy and there are enough of them sewn around the bag they are actually useful.  The bag is now hanging by one of those handles with no issues of tearing, ripping, or shredding.

Tree was 3 pieces, I wrapped the tree sections with that stretchy cellophane packing wrap - best way I can imagine to control the needle fluff. That left me a 4' x 24"" base, a 4' by 18"" mid section, and a 2' x 12"" top.  Base went in large end first, mid section skinny end first, and that left a lot of room for the top at the opposite end of the bag; also dropped a few more Christmas display items in for good measure.

The result was heavy; but lifting the bag didn't result in any tears or punctures (honestly, I was expecting one of the pole ends to push through at some point).  Once I had the bag where I wanted it, I tied a rope to one of the end handles, and hoisted the bag off the floor.  Now the tree is out of the way, and stored in a good spot where it won't get banged around.

The duffel bag is probably too big for most any other use I can imagine; but was perfect for storing my $400 tree.  Though I may buy another to store ALL of my camping gear in one spot and allow me to lift it off the floor, too. Hmmm...  glad I wrote this review :)"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,Not as comfortable as I thought. Back digs into heal. Hoping they break in.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.  The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of times converting to Russian and it works pretty well.

All in all I think this is kind of a niche product.  The size limits the market even more, as it's huge."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I got this ring as a pinky ring. It fit perfect and looks just the way they said. It is of high quality and will definitely be buying more from here.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"For me this was exactly the size purse I was looking for.  The outside feels really nice and there are tons of compartments. For the price,  this was better than I expected.

You do  get what you pay for though.  The inside feels and looks very cheap and I don't love the feel of the strap.  I took no points off for these issues because they are minor and if I expected a higher quality I should pay more.  This purse was exactly as described and perfect for me.  I would definitely recommend it and when it wears out I will probably buy another."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I normally wear a 36D, and depending on the bra I'm wearing I sometimes get a little bulge in the cleavage area. But if I go up to DD, the cups are too big.

These fit perfectly! They give me a nice natural shape, no bulge anywhere and super comfortable. I love them.

I have 2 of these, and I got them at Walmart for about $12 apiece. At the time I am writing this review, they are available on Walmart's website."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Only had them a week or so, but so far so good.  They fit well, and with me being  cabinet maker, customers love the wooden arms."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Love it! .......... sooooo comfortable you can't go wrong with one of these ..... washed up great as well.  I used warm wash and med dry.  Nice length, even for me  (I am 5'10"")."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"As an individual who has dealt with a small cup size all my life, I am used to disappointment when purchasing bras. Even more so now that I have gained weight, and can't even find my size in a store. So, despite the glowing reviews of this bra, I was prepared for yet another bra with puckered, too-large cups, and an uncomfortable band. Surprise! It fits and is extremely comfortable. Somehow, even though the sizing for 2X seems to indicate a C cup, (or above) the bra manages to both to fit and flatter my B-  sizing. And though the band in front does tend to wrinkle/fold over a little, I don't care. A bra that flatters and is comfortable is rare, and I am purchasing more."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I would have given this 5 stars but I have only been carrying it a while and already the straps are coming off. The tiny straps that hold on the big straps are only stapled on, not sewn! Did I buy a knock off? I cannot believe Michael Kors would use staples.  The style and size are fantastic. I will take it to the shoe repairs and have him sew it back together."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"It's a really lovely ring! i love it, i purchased it with a pendant and earrings, but most of all i liked this one."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"These are super cute, very comfortable and warm. I don't like to wear them barefoot as I can feel the seams, but with a pair of socks they are just right. Fun slippers, well crafted. I've gotten compliments from friends and family."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I love the FRYE boot, it is more than what I expected."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Just right!  The color is perfect and the fit is great.  I really like it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"What can I say, they hold my pants up.  The clips are sturdy and they are easily adjustable.  Good alternative to a belt."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"This is my 4th purchase, this exercise bra is supportive, it fits well, it's comfortable and it doesn't loose it's shape.  I highly recommend it.  I've tried sports bras that have cost twice as much and have been utterly disappointing.  If you're broad shouldered or endowed this is the sports bra for you."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,love the shoe and fits well.  I have narrow feet so there is a bit of gap but not noticeable.  Only problem is they squeak when I walk.  Wonder about WD-40 on the sisal -:)
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"These are awesome tights but the camel toe they give...
I got a medium, fit very nicely. High waisted and a little too stretchy on the ankle. For size reference I'm 5'6, roughly 150lbs, and about a 28 in waist.

Update: I worked out for them for the first time, super comfy but crap they are thin. Squat proof but your panties line is extremely obvious. I also like the back of the calf panel of slightly preferated material."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,They fit snug but that is part of why they do such a great job preventing hotspots and blisters-- no more sliding around! I love them for the gym and mowing the lawn. I also appreciate that they are made in America.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I normally take a half size bigger in sneakers to leave room for toes when I run.
However, so far so good even though I took my exact size. Fits snuggle-ly too. Quite comfy. After my last pair of Asics were used until they couldn't run another mile, I stuck to the brand and I'm glad I did."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Great quality but I thought it would be a little bigger , overall it's a great wallet"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Very good looking, well-made shoe. My grandson loves his Chucks, as he calls them. He wears them to work, but he does add gel arch support soles as he's on his feet a lot."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Planning to travel to Japan meant a 14-hour flight  in coach!  That made it imperative that both my husband and I purchase and wear compression socks.  After I researched various brands and styles, Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large were better suited to my husbands picky preferences than other options.  Stockwell uses a higher percentage of natural fibers than many other brands of socks.  As a result, they wicked moisture better and did not make his feet to sweat more profusely.  They were firmer (20  30 mm Hg) than the majority of compression socks (10  20 mmHG).  The socks graduated compression and well-fitted feet made Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large the socks for him.

Sizing is always a challenge when it comes to purchasing any clothing online.  My husband wears an 11 to 11  Medium in shoes.  The Large/X-Large size fits him well and is comfortable.  At its maximum point, his calf is about 16 in circumference.  The socks extend to the crease in the back of his knees  about 17"" from the floor; this circumference of area also measures about 16.  His foot is 11 long and the circumference around the arch is about 9 .

Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large are constructed with care.  Unlike my socks that had a more prominent knot on one side of the toe area, my husbands socks had smooth toe seams.  The top of the sock has a rolled, zigzag-stitched hem that approximately 3/8 wide.  It has not rolled during wearing.

Although these socks can be machine washed and dried, I prefer to hand wash and dry them flat.  I believe this will increase their useful life.  Amazons price for these socks, combined with PRIME shipping and free returns, makes them a much better value than the same item purchased from one of the online travel clothing retailers."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I ordered four bathrobes to choose from. So far, I have received two, including the Natori Divine Robe in Midnight Blue. It is beautiful! It's very well made, soft as could be and warm without being suffocating like some heavier robes. The length is perfect. I love the color; it's much prettier in person. My husband loves the look of it on me. I am very happy with this robe! The sleeves were rolled up and tacked in place but I removed the tacking. I like my sleeves long on these types of robes."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"This was my first purchase of anything in the ATACS FG pattern and I must say I am very happy with the pattern.

The boonie looks well made out of very good quality made materiel, There are some slight assembly/sewing discrepancies if you look for them but nothing that would affect performance or concealment.

The outer ""utility"" band (the band you stick extra foliage) is made from shiny OD green nylon webbing, which detracts somewhat from the very flat, subdued pattern of the rest of the hat. I wish they could have used flat tan cotton webbing on it, or just doubled over some of the ripstop material that the rest of the hat is made from. It kind of sticks out on it in my own opinion. Not a big issue though, and the only thing I would change about it.

NOTE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL: This hat does NOT meet NIR Specs (Near Infrared Signature Management Technology)

Overall this is a very good buy for the money and I am well pleased with the purchase.

As far as sizing goes I have an old GI tan boonie made by propper that I've worn for years now and has been washed multiple times. It is a size a 7.25 (or 7 1/4) and right now it fits my head like a rubber band, even with only small amount of hair on my head. I considered also getting this boonie in 7.25 as well but chose 7.5 instead. I'm glad I did, 7.5 fits loose on my head but still tight enough to be comfortable. After a couple trips through the washer it will still be comfortable. Some good advice that propper put on the label is:

INITIAL LOOSE FIT REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED COMFORT!

So it's OK if you have a loose fit with it. It will shrink over time. Very happy all around with this purchase."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Got for a buddies wedding. Yet to use it but seems to be good for the price.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Seem pretty good, but I haven't really worn them for a couple hours at a time. I had return my 1st pair and get a bigger size & these were a little tight, but after a few wears they are about perfect."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,Very cute but just too small even though my other small exofficio shirts fit.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,"I also ordered 2E.  Way too narrow--cramped my feet right away.  Had to take them off and return.  Was VERY disappointed.  I have a pair of 2E mesh asics that are VERY comfortable.  Really wanted the non-mesh to work, but no dice."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to.
This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out.
Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that.
The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure!
The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice.
The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around.
The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow.
It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too.
It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear.
Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf.
I was fortunate enough to receive this scarf at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Great comfortable sandals for all day wear. But beware they are narrow.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,My husband is very picky about wallets. This one he loves!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,These are well made and the fabric stands up to a lot of wear and tear.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"You can wear the hood by itself, wear it with the hood, or wear just the jacket without the hood.  How is that for 3-in-1 systems?

Reminiscent of what Lands End sells as a ""Squall Jacket"", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.

Water and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.

Polyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.

I can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.

If it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.

Better garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.

I guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.

Garment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.

I've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.

And to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I purchased this belt because the XL was too small. Well, of course this belt is too big. I will be adding another hole to make it fit me. I wish there were a size in between the two, otherwise it's a good purchase."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,Product is smaller than expected.  This item was purchased twice (one for me and one for another).  Both had to be exchanged and seller requires purchaser to pay for return shipping on exchanges which cost over $10.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I love this watch. I use the quick timer for watching the garden water and cooking. I set the alarm to remind me of places I have to be. It tells the correct time. I lasts and lasts. I had the battery replaced after a long time.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"This wedding ring set arrived very quickly.  It really is a very nice set at a very reasonable cost.  It arrived in a very beautiful black velvet ring box.  I would not plan to wear this as an everyday ring set, since it is not a full white gold, just white gold plated, I would not expect it to hold up as well.  I like to wear different rings for different occasions, especially when traveling, so I don't have to worry about losing my actual ring set or having it stolen.

This set is very dainty looking and quite nice.  I ordered a size 7, which is what my original set is, and it fits perfectly. It's very comfortable to wear.  I take it off to wash my hands and I wouldn't sleep in it, so I have not seen any discoloration on the metal or on my hands.  For the price that this is offered at, I would definitely recommend it for someone to purchase as an extra set to wear on occasion.

Like most online shoppers, I read through reviews posted by others to determine whether I want to try out a product. I always do what I can to help by describing my purchases honestly. If I have been helpful please check yes, that it was helpful to you and I will do the same for all of the helpful reviews I find! Thank you for reading."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I own a lot of Chuvora jewelry and have never been disappointed. This ring is substantial but not heavy. Shiny. The size 9 was a perfect fit for my index finger. I really like jewelry from Chuvora.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I followed the advice of the other reviewers and ordered my Georgia Boot Romeos a half-size larger than usual, and they fit perfectly.  They were extremely comfortable right out of the box, and i have been happy with them ever since.  Highly recommend."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"The pants are well made, we like the cotton and wool fabric and the color"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"Cute, but they are only going to be comfortable on someone with a narrow foot."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Beautiful vibrant skirt, but snug at the waist. Size up."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I'm not an audiophile. My golden ears from yesteryear have tarnished rather badly.  I wanted a no-frills subwoofer to balance out my good-but-small bookshelf speakers. The first of these units arrived damaged: the grille had sheared off and could not be reattached. The company was perfect. They told me what to do and sent a replacement unit with no complaint or hassle. It came quickly. The instructions aren't the very clearest, but it didn't take long to figure it out and set it up. One complaint: whoever designed the connector array never, ever tried to connect anything to it. The connectors, even if they were well placed, are hard to use; but they're crammed together such that my not-very-big fingers had a heck of a time connecting the speakers. Much bad language was used. In terms of function, I can set the unit to make much more boom-boom than I want or to be almost silent - or anything in between, including a setting I like. The other speakers are routed through this unit, which ostensibly leads to better balance. Can't prove it by me, but the result seems fine."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The best there is. Uses a DVI video connection, should be HDMI in 2016. That is a little out of date, had to buy an adapter, no problem though. Love it."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Hello people I bought a Nikon p500 great camera and I wanted a carry cad for it and I got this one and it's perfect fit and it's not bad for the price so try it out it really good thank u have a great day
Electronics_5,5,OR,My second one. Hope it is as good as the first.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Very sturdy surge strip for a solid price. Haven't had my house struck by lightning, so I can't comment on the effectiveness, but I'm trusting $1000 of hardware to it."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"nothing special. they produce muddy sound, but for what they are built for they do just fine."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Much more durable than the corresponding Apple case for a fraction of the price.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Did not correctly fit my 20"" screen. If it fit I would have kept it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Works Great. I have two 23"" 16x9 monitors mounted on the stand.  Probably works best with matching monitors.  Might throw the balance off otherwise.  There is no independent monitor height adjustment, so same sized or matching monitors are best.  Works on my glass desk with the stand option."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Helps to keep my Jaybird Bluebuds in ear without the wings, works great, hold up long, don't get too nasty and i just wipe off on shirt if they come out with a friend (sorry gross but it doesn't look dirty afterwards)"
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I bought this for the TTL ... then I realized that the best results can be achieved only in Manual ...
The other problem, it doesn't support HSS which is a mandatory for shooting in the daylight (flash as fill)"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great purchase
Bought this one because the office pull boxes were painful.
This bag is nicely constructed, nice compartments, and even distribution of weight. The wheels roll smoothly. It's not high society style, but perfect for my needs."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Works great ! just be careful of putting to much cleaner on your dash but even with that you have to take corner pretty fast to get this to slide. I would def buy again
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I have 4 tablets; HP G2 10"" android; Dell Venue Pro 8"" windows; Vulcan Excursion 10"" windows and an Ipad Mini-2.  These work on the Ipad about 60% of the presses I make.  The Dell they work on about 1 in 5 times I press it to the surface.  The HP they work about 7 our of 10 times and the Vulcan hardly at all.  I don't know why they act this way.  I have an iHome stylus/pen (looks like a pen with the rubber tip at the top part) and it works 80-100% across all devices.  The company is great, they send follow up emails and the package is nice.  I only received 1 lanyard but it's ok; I didn't contact them to send another.  For me at 7-bucks they're thrown in the drawer and my iHome pen is clipped in my Venue Pro case.  They're built well but just don't work great on any of the 4 tablet devices I have, eh?  Get 'em if you've tried a friends on your device and they work. For me, not so much and if I require another stylus it'll be a 2nd iHome pen/stylus.  Great contact/sales follow-up; product about the cost of a burger lunch and as memorable."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"This was purchase for my girlfriends new 2011 13.3 macbook air. When it was designed I doubt there was any test fitting or any testers before mass producing this. For there are some issues with the bottom piece. When it is fully clipped on the top part hits the screen lid when you lift open then screen which can damage and make marks on the lid. My second issues is the little kick feet. I found them very useful but one is very loose and when carrying or moving the macbook air it makes a annoying clicking noise. On the good note this is a good strong case, light weight, and keeps the thinness of the macbook air looking thin. Until they fix this issues I don't recommend this product due to the annoying flaws."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The specs are pretty self-explanatory. It's fast and has 8 threads, and you can make it faster if you want.  Doesn't come with a CPU cooler like the cheap ones do."
Electronics_5,5,OR,i love this case it has a nice black finish and all components fit comfortably inside with room to spare. It also has ample room for cooling and extras.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"It appears that Arcos has skimped to make this a cheaper model. A MAJOR negative that the potential capacity is really a lot less than perceived. This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all. Skip this unit (however DON'T get a Ipod)."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"great router, easy to set up and use. Really helped my whole network"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Fantastic bag! I looked at and purchased a few other laptop bags from Samsonite, Incase, etc. and nothing comes close to this. They use YKK zippers, have multiple pockets with soft lining to not scratch up laptops, iPads, etc. and this case has plenty of pockets but not too many!"
Electronics_5,3,OR,Was a bit cumbersome to use. Didn't realize I needed the battery pack that stored more charge. Two fully charged batteries died within 10-15 mins of use. I can't totally fault to mount but wish there was some kind of indicator on the adapter to let operator know how much charge left in battery.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Quality items.  I bought these for modding my PS3 60GB PHAT model along with a 120mm fan, to allow more air flow since those original models get hot and the internal fan sounds like a jet engine at highest RPM.

Great seller, and excellent product."
Electronics_5,1,OR,Not comfy at all (on my head at least). Was waaay to tight so I would not recommend these headphones to anyone ever.
Electronics_5,5,OR,has a rubbery feel and and is just the right size for the ipod 5.. a gloss back color.. can be taking on and of with no problems..
Electronics_5,5,OR,I work on alot of computers for people. Never went wrong with APC batteries. Fast shipping and a genuine replacement part. APC has a good reputation and couldn't be happier with my purchase..
Electronics_5,5,OR,I use them almost every day and have no issue to report. Ill never use another product again.
Electronics_5,4,OR,Looks to be of a good quality. I've tested it in and my lab and everything seemed to work properly.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Fit my TP-1a perfectly.
This is as good quality as the original ones that came with my (then) $150 headset (2009).
Great stuff for the price!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I purchased this as my backup/office adapter for you Yoga 13.  The power brick is not as thin as the original adapter, but it is still pretty smart.  It has worked perfectly with my unit.  I would highly recommend getting this if you do not already have a backup to original adapter.

If you already have an older Lenovo adapter or third-party multi-piece AC adapter, I would recommending checking out Patuoxun Power Adapter Cable for ThinkPad X1 Carbon 0B47046 UltraBook PC (this is the Amazon title for the product).  This will likely meet your needs and save you money.  I know it says it works for another specific computer, but you can check out the reviews to see it is universal to other Lenovo laptops."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I really liked this bag the first two times I used it. Plenty of room, comfortable, and seemed pretty secure. However the second time I took it through the airport, one of the front hooks came off. Couldnt find it. Turns out that they're not sewn on. Theyre just hooked on with two small hooks.

Im sitting at the airport halfway through my fourth trip and it seems that Ive lost the other one. Too bad. If the hooks were sewn on this would be a very happy five star review."
Electronics_5,5,OR,No problem so far. They all checked good on my battery checker.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I'm building a terminator. This unit will provide power to the lower voltage systems such as the eyes and its left pinky toe.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"There's a hum that disappears when I turn on my itouch, but it is annoying when I turn it on. But the price was right for the little I use it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I purchased this monopod in anticipation of a week-long vacation. I wanted an alternative for taking photos on day trips where I wouldn't need to lug along my full tripod.  When the monopod arrived, I was amazed at how lightweight the whole ensemble was.  In it's little carrying case, it seemed to weigh less than my cellphone.  Plus, completely collapsed, it fit perfectly into the bottom of my messenger bag.  While taking pictures, the monopod helped tremendously and I barely ever regretted bringing it along.  After the vacation, it stayed in the bottom of my bag and I haven't been bothered by keeping it there.
My only slight minus to the product is the rubber washer that goes between the pod and camera came unglued after the first time I screwed the camera on.  However, I just used cement to put it back in place and everything works fine."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Very Very fantastic camera. Have other full size sensor SLR's and this easily holds its own. The Leica summicron lens with nano coating and digital filter is second to none. Can you say Value? Knew you could. A++++
Really wide angle as well."
Electronics_5,1,OR,"Doesn't seem to work well with Mac devices. My USB 3.0 hard drive keep connecting and disconnecting repeatedly.

The charging ports seem to work fine but the layout of the ports on this are terrible. The right front and rear ports charge and provide connectivity and the front left ports charge only. This is problematic for my desk as the cut through for cable is on the left side.... where the charge only ports are located. Thus, I have to drag cables across my desk to plug them in making my desk look messy. The whole point of this was to allow me to ""hide"" my laptop under the unit, place a monitor on top and then route all of the cables in a clean manner.

I will tinker with it a little more but if I cannot get it to stop this connecting/disconnecting to stop I might have to return the unit and look for another alternative."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"While there's not much to truly get excited over concerning a replacement snap-on lens cap, this one is well designed and does exactly what it should. It is easy to properly secure to the front of the camera lens and stays in place until removed.  I'll give this product ""FIVE"" Amazon stars!"
Electronics_5,2,OR,This speaker stopped working and now it doesn't turn on so I'm returning it
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Installed this system on my '13 corvette, everything works great, I installed the monitor into the sun visor, all the cables were long enough for my car, but probably not for a truck/suv ,camera bracket covers a small part of sticker on license plate may have to trim end off, 170 degree angle is closer to 130 but picture is very clear, for the price this is a great camera monitor system"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This tower is big for a mid tower but I like it

Came warped in plastic

Clean Nice paint job

Cant complain yet great tower!!!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Hit the spot. Needs more fan headers but a stable performer.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Product works Great!!!  I seriously came home seeing a box and I was like, what the hell is this?  Then after opening i couldn't believe this part was already at my door!!  It was seriously there like 12 hours after i ordered it.  Wicked Fast..."
Electronics_5,5,OR,This clock is so cute and durable. I got it for my little girl so it would teach her responsibility in getting up on her own. I love the pink color and how it lights up pink. The covering is pink silicone. You set the time with the two buttons on top and it has the alarm set button on the left side use the hour and minutes buttons along with the alarm set button to set the alarm. You can use the button on the right side to cut the alarm off and on. It also has a snooze light button on top so you can see the time better in the dark. Push the button and the clock will illuminate for about 5 seconds so you can see the time. It runs on 3 AAA batteries (not included). Thank you for taking time to read my review :)
Electronics_5,5,OR,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

Electronics_5,2,OR,"After about 4 months of sporadic problems, I've given up and gone to Netgear's MIMO. This device has been problematic every time the power was recycled. I've done complete resets using the reset button on the back (10 seconds) and the wireless, DHCP just don't work anymore. Can't even access the web based administration page using the 192. 168. 1. 1 address. When it worked range was good, but I have to recomend the Netgear at this point. [."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This was a well made case, good quality for a very reasonable price. It was a gift to hold a portable car dvd player (also a gift) and there is plenty of room for the whole system and plenty also for extras. Very happy with it."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"This item was right in my price range to being practicing with reflectors and diffusers.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I question how long it's gonna last.  It appears to be made similar to a sun shade you'd put in your car windshield to keep the heat down, and I'd imagine the metal will bend out of shape sooner rather than later.  This observation was made on more than one review, but a few people have reported back saying it's going strong.  Bottom line is that even if it does bend out of shape, I can buy 10 more at the same price as one of the higher end kits... so this seems like the best investment.  I would recommend this product!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I really like this backpack. They look nice stylish, have a lot of space too. I can take it any where."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"They are solidly built and are very comfortable to me. However, I'm disappointed with the sound quality. I own a pair&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sennheiser-PXC-450-NoiseGard-Active-Noise-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B000R2PC2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sennheiser PXC 450 NoiseGard Active Noise-Canceling Headphones</a>, which sound great, but wanted the IE6 for when I don't want to carry the bulky PXC450. I was expecting the same great sound fidelity as it is a Sennheiser, but that was not the case. I felt the sound had good bass, but was distorted and lacking a bit on highs. To be sure, in my latest trip I just bought a pair of the very inexpensive&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-MDREX36V-BLU-EX-Earbud-Headphone-Blue/dp/B001EYU3JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony MDREX36V/BLU EX Earbud Headphone (Blue)</a>, and they sounded much better then the IE6 - better clarity and overall balance of lows, mid, and highs, for less than a third of the price! Another problem with the IE6 is that they're too loud (115db/V), meaning you'd need an extra volume control if you plug it into an airplane audio socket. The Sony EX36V already has a volume control built-in, and isolates outside noise better than the IE6. Still not the same sound fidelity as the PXC450, but not bad for less than $30. Go with the Sony EX36V..."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This case is perfect for my new Kindle Fire.  When I first got it I didn't think I was going to like it...I had to get used to holding it while using the tablet and I kept pulling the Kindle out of it while I played games.  However, after a day or two I got used to the case and it looks great and protects my new favorite toy!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Very impressed. I am so happy with the details of the this pen. It will be a hit at our Anniversary.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The Milkshake stays nice and cold in this, and feels like you're drinking a milkshake from an authentic fountain - a must have for milkshake or smoothie lovers!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love these pillows! What a great value for two. Every bed should have these. By the way, Bed, Bath and Beyond sells covers for these."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Although a good price, these smell like rotten fish. Brides - beware. Open at least a week before the wedding and separate your petals. I had to spray mine daily and the smell was still not gone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This was a little bit smaller than expected, but it works well for insulating both hot or cold food. I wish there were more styles and colors to choose from for my daughters."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Save a ton by using these instead of paper towels!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The plates are okay.  We ordered 2 boxes (12 plates total), and both boxes snapped open during shipping, chipping the edge of one plate.  The Black circular imprint is well done, but not quite centered in the plates, and each plate exhibits some 'uniqueness' in shape.  They are fine for our purpose and the price is certainly nice.  Was hoping for more here, but you do get what you pay for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I wanted a good sturdy slip cover to protect my chairs from kids.  These do that job well.  They get dirty, but they are easy to take on and off and wash up in the washing machine really well.  I'd buy them again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Went together OK and looks good in the corner. The color is very dark
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Tore apart easier than toilet paper. Its so cheaply put together. Do not waste your time and money.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are the handiest hangers for drying undergarments. I absolutely LOVE them. They take up very little room and can be hung anywhere. I'm going to buy several more sets to give to my daughters.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is a great quality product and fits in nicely with our kitchen. It's a sturdy product that holds a ton of stuff and does the job! Would recommend.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are great for starting charcoal in the grill.  Burn long enough to get a good coal going.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The ""polish"" already shows lots of scratches, though I can not tell if it is that or the steel itself.  The thick glass lids are very good, and they actually can match other pans and visa versa.  There's very little problem with food sticking after light use.
Three Stars because there is evidence of being stained from the electric stove, so they are not in fact ""stainless"" as suggested."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great item, I purchased this to add to my collection of heart shaped pans in preparation for Valentine's day. Now I have three different sizes that gives me more options for decorating. This is the standard Wilton pan material but in a heart shaped. It's the smallest size and light weight aluminum material. It is a light color pan, not the dark colored. It will work well for making heart shaped cakes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Worked great!! A little hard to fold into the box !! But they looked great and stayed put once it was accomplished!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,So much on a  dinner table. we really enjoy this and have ordered several for wedding gifts
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Fun ornament. Very well made with a great attention to detail. Good size too. It is a gift for my brother, who likes quirky ornaments and I'm sure he will love it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I didn't even know I needed this bottle opener, and now I'm obsessed. Always conveniently located right on the fridge, but small enough that it's not tacky. Our friends always comment on how handy it is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I was quite disappointed in this. The picture of the comforter and pillow covers is what I excepted to get.
Instead you get a large cover for your comforter to go into. It is very soft but thin. It is not a comforter as shown in the picture. You also get 2 pillow covers. I also thought I was getting gray and I got all white. I did get this at a reduced rate but I would not purchase this again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Little smaller than I anticipated but it is perfect for what I ordered it for . Very light weight and easy to hang.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Love these bottles. Had a problem one was broken and the seller was easy to deal and replaced the broken bottle no problem. I would definitely buy again
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My wife and I have already made multiple batches of gummies with this product. I was afraid the dropper to fill them wasn't going to work, however I was very pleased. After letting them sit up they popped right out and were delicious!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My Grandsons are huge Mario & Luigi fans.  These are beautifully detailed, bold colors, soft, and comfy.  They loved them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Love the print and color of these rugs but they are very very thin. Great accent pieces but the runner is an unusual size and the small area rug is very small.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,I bought this to cook brown rice...It takes a LONG time to cook! It also takes up a LOT of space on my counter.  Not sure I'll use it all that much for fact.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt. A redesign where filter is attached directly to motor housing with positive and fool proof installation would solve this problem. Other than this problem a really great product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This Next-shine digital scale is super cute!!! I have wanted to have a smaller scale around the house for some time now.. For mailing things out, weighing food ect. I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

* I received this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. These opinions are my own and have not been influenced by anyone for any reason!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I used it today and it worked wonderfully. I put the unit in the refrigerator in my lunch bag so I could grab and go with morning.  My homemade soup was nice and warm by lunch time.  No more waiting for the microwave, how nice is that.  I'm going to do pasta dishes next.  I'm really glad this is part of my lunch gear.  It works well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Pretty but not functional. Fabric is too light and it doesn't stay in place whatsoever no matter how often you adjust it. Give it 3-stars due to the description being accurate and loving the color
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Exactly what I wanted.  My old sifter was the squeeze handle type and around 52 years old.  Right now using that type is difficult.  This is compact and works perfectly plus you get the plastic lids.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great cup. Will last forever. Keeps things cool / warm.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"after checking all over for the perfect toaster, we found this one. It toasts to each family members likes. Easy to use, toasts large pieces bread.  Plug is in frount , little inconvienent, but can live with it. Amazon had the best price. would recomend this toaster"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,i did half of my polo shirt and almost used half of the tank. It works though so i am good.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This item has one function, and doesn't hold up to that function. The sides of the ball don't close tight enough to prevent little particles of tea getting into your water. Don't buy it, get something else."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,Great chair however the left arm broke off after a few months. I fixed it with gorilla glue. Pretty disappointed in the quality.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"magnet doesn't have much strength so really cant be used that way,I was going to send it back until I found a way to wedge it into a cupboard and now its a wee bit better,the alarm works well and is easy to use"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"It is my second Primula Espresso Coffee Maker. I should say that the quality went down significantly. The previous one had rubber gasket between upper and lower parts, this one has cheap plastic stuff which leaks when you pour the hot coffee. It is very unpleasant experience. Top portion of the maker has also deteriorated from the previous model. Hadn't I trashed the original box, I would have returned the maker after the very first use.

Ordered a rubber gasket to replace the original plastic one.

Update: the maker was returned as the quality of the product was below expectations. Rate was changed from 2 stars to 1. Not recommended for purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"After using this for the past year or so, some if the clips are starting fall off kind of easily.  No big deal, just push it right back on the rope.  For the price, it's definitely worth it.  Great for display if you don't plan on taking your hats on and off of it much."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Interface could be slightly more intuitive but after pushing buttons several times you'll figure it out.  Nice having two different thermometers to check different parts of the meat.  I use this for cooking in the oven.  I leave the timer outside and put the meat in with the thermometers and this works fine.  I didn't see a way to set the timers to a specific temperature other than the presets, rare, medium rare, for the meat type.  Its not really a problem though, I really just wanted a way to see where the meat was at without opening the oven and/or cutting into it and also to set a timer just in case I forget.  I'd recommend this, I've used it a couple times now without issue.  There is an on/off switch too which should help with the battery."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a home roaster and use this filter after brewing coffee in a pan on the stove (4 minutes at 190-200 degrees).  I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great quality.  They handle heat well and are nice and thick.  They can be used for opening jars and bottles as well.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am soooo glad I had this on our last cruise; I have never had such watered down drinks  I would leave the bar with their glass, and add my own alcohol."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought a  couple of the duvet covers and they are so nice,  silky  and soft."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love them, just thought they would be a bit bigger!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This works just as well as my old Kitchen-aid mixer did and it's not as cumbersome. My only suggestion to the manufacturer is it needs a bowl with a handle.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I purchased this for new furniture that will be delivered later this week.  I am used to leather but this time purchased microfiber. Was worried about the dog getting on the recliner and getting it dirty.  Will post a later review on how it works out once furniture is delivered.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is a very low napped rug. I thought it was gray and white but it looks more like gray and cream. I have it in a high traffic area and its easy to keep clean. Im very happy with this.
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Without giving anything away this story is an up and down ride of emotions and choices. While I would have liked to have a more uplifting ending, it was still a good read."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Pretty simple recipes. All can be found online. These are simple, oils & butters only. None that require a preservative or water or emulsfying wax"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This is yet another great addition to the Back-Up series and I loved reading this! The full range of emotions are covered here and I loved how well everything rounded out with this novella. Reading this entire series has been a great adventure filled with complex characters, an incredible storyline and an author that always leaves me wanting more. I highly recommend reading this to anyone and I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I picked this book up free on Amazon. It was well worth the price I paid LOL!

It was an okay book. It read quickly and was intriguing even if a little predictable. The writing was okay. There was decent character development. If you are looking for a quick, fast read, this could satisfy that need."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Great story.  Only negative observation is that it was a novella.  Keep 'em coming, Mr. Rollins."
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,Story line was easy to follow. Plot was good.characters  we're good.  Should have been longer. Recommend to others to read.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I was quite spell-bound about this book. God uses ordinary people to do extraordinary things. The lessons learned indicate that God is so alive today and speaks through his Word. Why did God use this child, one would want to know, but God uses us everyday to share his word. We are sometimes afraid to speak to others concerning how God works. I went to the website and listened to Ms. Brown share the story. As the story progressed, the reader is praying for a miracle to take place and Tara is healed completely but God had different plans."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The best part about the 3rd installment of the IMA series is that it looks like it's not going to be a trilogy! The ending definitely sets things up for a continuation and that means more of my favorite fictional couple!

Locked and Loaded picks up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina's first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she wants him"" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him ""Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn't work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters. (More hot sex and detailed fetish exploration would not be remiss either."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,I really liked this mail order bride book. It was a nice clean romance book. I would recommend this book to all my family and friends
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Wipes brow and has a cold shower! Holy hotness, sugary female sweetness with a little bit of alpha male to thicken the mix!!

I love me some lady love with a man in the mix but for some reason well written FFM m&eacute;nage is a hard find.

On my search I stumbled across this 'freebie' so nabbed it. Not only did it deliver on FFM but also panty wetting smoking hot FFMF!

Emme was a new to me author, but no longer...scurries off to check out more of her work!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Sometimes I want a good, short, read, and this one did the trick.  I tried to guess all the way through who the arsonist might be.. I read a lot of suspense and usually have a suspect in mind.  Not so with this book.  The romance between Carlisle and Chet, as well as Mike and Kelly was wholesome and cute.  I loved the sixty-something Violet and her boyfriend with the bat. You can't go wrong with this one."
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"Maybe it was just me, but the way this one was written made it really hard for me to get into the story.  I was constantly sighing, rolling my eyes and thinking ""really, please tell you you did NOT just say that!"".  The romance was a one-day instalove that was so corny it wasn't entertaining, believable or even likeable.  The ""fight scenes"" were a joke (it was like watching a movie fight where the camera is pointed at their feet) .....sounds terrible right?  It was! There was no incentive to read another book at all."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"She is a saint I pray with each day, for her intercession for special intentions. Our parish Church and community  is named after this great saint."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Loved the characters, loved the story, loved the sweet romance.  Innocence personified in its entirety.  Can't wait to read more from this author."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,Things are starting to heat up now and secrets are coming out. Will he reveal all of them and is he really falling for her or is it just a ruse. I'm intrigued to find out.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I loved the story and even tho it bogged down a bit in the middle I enjoyed it and wanted to keep reading the next story.
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"While I thought the likelihood of two people quickly falling for each other after 14 years of never seeing each other and not having any contact with each other prior to their marriage of convenience infinitely small, I somehow still enjoyed this. The setting was peaceful, the lead characters were likeable, and the children were adorable. A fluffy, angst-free escape if you don't think hard about the plot."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I have loved H since Nineteen. I always knew he was someone special. I laughed at his antics, cried at his struggle, then basked in triumph over Big C! Now I get to see him fall in love! This was what I wanted for him; this is what he deserves! And what a great partner for him. I love a strong woman, and  Lilac does not disappoint.

This is my favorite book in this series so far. I recommend this book...highly! You will love it! You will love Lilah from the the top of her head, to the end off AllyTastic, and Harry from his heart to his Davidson!  Absolutely wonderful!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is one I hope never ends! The author is gifted, her stories come to life and they've managed to take over mine lately!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,This book is unusual to say the least. The beginning keeps you guessing for a while as strange events start to happen to Evie. You start to get little hints about what is happening until your teased with thoughts of the greek gods. What happens when the gods are threatened? well there is an unusual theory in this book. My curiosity kept me going and by the end I found myself really interested in what was going to happen to poor Evie. Is she going to make it? Will she come to terms with what is happening to her or will her mortal body fail? I guess I'm going to have to find out lol. There is explicit adult content and violence.
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Its a good book. I enjoyed it, but there's a lot of missing words in the book. It must b something with ebooks. I read a lot, and I'he noticed ebooks have a lot of missing words. All in all tho, this series was a good a good read!"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Wow this is a scorching hot short story, and so true how many times have I talked to others in the book club about this kind of stuff. Amazing can't wait to read the next book."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,This book was a very heartwarming book!! I hope she turns it into a series! All the books by Hazel Gower that I read I have absolutely loved.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Not disappointed at all. This series gets better and better. I just love it. No, i adore it! It's amazing! I've been waiting for quite some time For Brandon's story and it was perfect. Just as i imagined it would be :) love these guys. They are all soooo good :)"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Ceony thought that the danger was over. She saved the magician she was apprenticing and put an end to the threat. She didn't expect to be targeted for revenge for what she did. She also didn't expect to have to hide a budding relationship with her mentor from everybody around her.

I have to be very honest, when I first started reading this book, I was trying to figure out why there was a need for sequels. Then it all hit at once and I fell into the story without another thought. It may have a very slow start, but the buildup behind it is amazing!

The narrator was as amazing in this as she was the first book. I really adored her. I'd love to listen to more books by this narrator. The story was good itself, but she enhanced it even more and brought life to all of the characters.

I do recommend this book very strongly. However, I recommend that the reader read the first book before picking this book up. Many references are made to the first book that may cause a reader who didn't read it to be very confused and not as interested in the story as they would be if they read the first."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Instantly hot, the plot draws you in and learn something new in every line. Well written, and very satisfying. Cannot wait for part two."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"While it was a fairly short story, it did tie up a lot of loose ends and allow us to finish up Ethan's story.  I really enjoyed it and am so looking forward to the continuation of the KGI series.  I haven't missed one yet and don't plan to start any time soon.  The books are well written and all of the characters that weave through all the stories are now like old friends.  It is always nice to be able to keep up with everyone, even if it is only a few words about what they are doing currently."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Any author who wants to include magic in their stories has go think of a consistent magic system unless s/he wants to be inundated with sneering letters from readers who love to pick things apart. K M
Shea combines recognizable  elements to good effect: the ability to read things into life (Inkheart), a magic council (too many to name), and magic law enforcement(ibid). The story move along a good pace and the characters are enjoyable."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"George Wier's ""Longnecks & Twisted Hearts"" is the third in the series of The Bill Travis Mysteries and the follow-up to ""The Last Call"" and ""Capitol Offense"". In ""Longnecks & Twisted Hearts"" Bill finds himself going back home, to his childhood hometown, to bury his once best friend. Upon reaching town limits he is met by a police officer wanting to escort him out of town before seeing the widow or attending the funeral. He was given a nice, friendly warning, but of course by now Bill's interests are really peaked. If he thought things were a bit strange with the widow's phone call, the police warning him off and escorting him out of town before he has a chance to see anyone, well now Bill has to stay and figure things out for himself. And boy does he ever get himself entangled in a lot of strange stuff along the way.

If you enjoyed ""The Last Call"" or ""Capitol Offense"" then you will really enjoy going on another thrill ride with Bill Travis. Bill Travis is just an ordinary guy who invests money for a living, yet he finds himself in some very strange situations. Pick up your copy today and take this journey home with Bill, you will not be disappointed and you will be thoroughly entertained."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Save Me is about Courtney Pierce and Rachel Sanders story. ""Her long neck is perfect for licks and nibbles and that's not even the half of it. That face, with her cupid's bow lips, long straight thin nose, high, arched brows the same shade as her hair, and brown eyes so warm I could drink them like hot cocoa. Her long brown hair is down, with a little bit of wave and it frames her face, making the perfect window. "" ~Courtney Pierce

Through the first two books comes together to bring in Court's POV and you will find out what happened between him and Annabella and things will come to light between Court and Rachel. Break Me ended in a small cliffy to start this book up with Rachel finding out she is pregnant. Is it Kellan's or someone's else?  No spoilers here so you will just have to see. I really loved this book and finding out more info on Ashley, Victor, Annabella and several unexpected twists to be revealed. Of course, you will have plenty of swoon worthy moments and angst to hold you over. Don't forget about the betrayal and enough steamy scenes to make up for it. I love this series! I reread them every time I have a chance to read the next book when it comes out!  Hope you enjoy!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Kian goes from being a playboy and ""the spare"" to Crown Prince in the blink of an eye when his twin brothe, Garrett, is kidnapped. For three agonizing months he's been drowning in fear and sorrow over his brother's plight yet having to put on his princely face and perform his princely duty. He's just about reached his breaking point when Savvy stumbles, lierally, into his life. She goes from saving him from a handsy title seeking woman and her daughter to saving his sanity. Savannah Breslin has ""been there, done a prince before"" routine and it broke her heart. She wants to protect her heart but being with His Royal Hotness breaks down her defenses. In turn Savvy becomes his anchor in the tumultuous storm of his brother's disappearance.  Duty keeps calling Kian away and his brother is finally rescued it seems he's pulled away from her more. Even though he's told her he loves her, she believes that they will never have a future because she is an American commoner. So she runs away to protect herself and deal with her breaking heart. Kian finds her and declares his love again backing it up with proposing. It seems this time she will get her prince and her happily ever after.

Tracy Wolff did a great job in combining two storylines: the hot and heavy romance of Kian and Savvy and Kian's journey through the kidnapping and rescue of Garrett. As Kian experiences the angst, anger, rage and impotence of not being able to find his twin, the reader experiences the poer of those feelings right along with him. The sizzle between Savvy and Kian is palpable and practically leaps of the page. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and am looking forwarx to reading Garrett's story.."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"As with all your devotion books, this one did not disappoint! Great read!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I really, really liked this book although there were some grammatical errors. I have read it over and over as well as the volume that follows it."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Wow, book 2 in the Desert Guard series is even better than the 1st.  This is Miles & Hank's story, and it is filled with action, twists, self-discovery, determination and of course, a cute kid. I really liked that the characters are so real, complex and full of emotion.  I love the interplay between all the characters and the meddling of the goddesses.  I am so looking forward to Sean & Hannah's story and am impatient to read what I expect to be as good as the last two.  I also hope this world's stories continue as I want to read more about Tito, the children & even the fallen.
Review copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,Love the MC books by this author. Every one of them are extremely well written and keeps you engaged from start to finish. Ready for the next book.
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"Instead of just telling the story this author is forcing conflict between the main characters.  Advice to the author:  Go read Nalini Singh's Archangel series and get an education on anti-heroes.
My synopsis:  Supposedly mature adults in love acting like spoiled children with no hope of growing up.  Very frustrating read."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This complex novel, part science fiction, part alternate history, plays with ideas about the true nature of consciousness. It takes the reader into the minds of various real and imagined beings, including destroyers such as Francisco Pizarro, a son of Genghis Khan, and the Black Plague, as well as adherents of crackpot theories such as the Vril and orgone energy, and the mind of woman with schizophrenia. Historic figures, including Freud, Einstein, and Hitler also make their appearances.

If you enjoy the imaginations, mind games, and broad canvases of authors  like Umberto Eco or Philip K. Dick, you might enjoy this book. It doesn't quite reach their full heights of imagination, but it's still an intriguing exploration."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"In ""His (A Dark Erotic Romance Novel)"" we meet Kat and Gavriel. Kat is a college student who is working at the college library and is dared to kiss the first hot guy she sees, which happens to be Gavriel. This dare leads to her following him home and witnessing something no one was ever meant to witness. Admitted serial killer Gavriel doesn't expect to see the young woman who kissed him out of the blue at the library to be peeping in his windows and interrupting his pre-meditated murder, but when she does he has no choice - he has to keep her or kill her.

The plot had an interesting twist to the normal kidnap dark romance, which I enjoyed. I enjoyed both characters and liked that the author told the story from both POV. The chemistry between the characters was hot and the sex scenes hotter. This story hits a nice balance where it is dark enough that it should satisfy those with a interest in dark romance, but not so dark as to turn off the regular romantic suspense readers.

Overall, a recommended read."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I loved the book and storyline.  I encourage you to read it too!  I've been very pleased with the selection on the free section!  I have found many new authors this way!
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I loved this book from start to finish. Have you ever wanted to hug someone and choke them in the same breathe ? Well I did several times.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I saw this movie a long time ago. I loved it. I bought it because it is funny. The price was cheap
Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"This was almost unwatchable.  My question?  Did Jeremy Renner need the money?
I really don't have much else to say about this movie.  There were 2 times the F word was used and for no real reason.  It was rather a gratuitous use of the word.  J. Renner said it once and it was seemed so ridiculous.  The names Hansel and Gretel also seemed ridiculous as well in this movie."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I ordered the season and watched every episode back to back as soon as it became available. Epic! This season parts company from the books because there are no more novels at present, so purists will find a lot to dislike about this season. On the other hand, it is great TV with some fantastic acting by all of the male leads. Kit Harrington, Liam Cunningham and Stephen Dillane are powerful all the way through, and Tyrion and Sir Jorah are a delight as always. Great work from Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow.
As for the women, Arya and Brienne continue to surprise and delight, and Sansa gets a bit less like a wet noodle.  Circe is up to her usual tricks but as Bronn says, evil has a tendency to turn back on itself. Margery and her gran, the amazing Diana Rigg, rounded things out pretty nicely. Not much movement from Queen Dany but we are left with all sorts of interesting possibilities in the final episode.
There are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of Episode 10 and throughout the whole season with respect to Bran, and for the past 2 seasons with regard to Rickon and the wilding woman who was supposed to find somewhere safe for him. Episode 8 shows there is nowhere safe from the Whitewalkers.  Great special effects and settings round off an excellent season, not perfect, but certainly better than most things on TV these days. With any luck, there will be many more seasons to come."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"It's interesting seeing him do stand up as opposed to his weekly program, and observing the audience reaction to his politically incorrect ideas - which is what I like best about him as a comedian and political commentator.

Great movie and I love they didn't sugarcoat the truth! :)"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I remember seeing this film so long ago, and the story always fascinated me. Yeah it's an old black and white, but that's what makes it so classic. Myself, I prefer the black and white films as they were released. Colorizing them just takes away the focus you have on the movie. But, I am going to purchase, I think, two more versions. Like I said before, I really like the concept of this film."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This is about a man whose son is a world traveler that is on his way down the Camino de Santiago when he falls to his death.  His father completes his journey.  It changes his life.  It's about the hardships and people he meets along the way.  Starring real life father and son, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez.  Wonderful scenery and story."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,this has to be one of the best Bond films in the top 5. I have seen all 007 movies an own them all on dvd. Watched Skyfall 3 times in the first couple of days.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"Buy the Region 2 DVD (released by Fabulous Films in 2008) from amazon UK. It's widescreen (*not* pan & scan), plus it comes with a Director's Commentary which offers good insights from Joseph Sargent (who also directed the original ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"").

Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.

*********************
UPDATE November 2009
Looks like this has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Wonder if that means a proper Region 1 release (widescreen) might be in the works? Maybe a 40th Anniversary Edition next year??"
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Good movie, but you need to understand the story prior to watch it."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This film reminds me of MTV's biorhythm.

I can't say i was deeply touched but it was a good film. I'm glad i saw it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Cate is the iconic Elizabeth.  No one has done this historical figure any better as far as I can see.  Highly entertaining.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This was purchased as a gift, meaning that someone else (not me) has watched it.  The response that I recieved was great however, so this gets good marks."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"If you like the stars, you'll probably like this romantic comedy.  It follows a typical--though not entirely predictable--formula, but both stars are delightful throughout."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Strangers With Candy is a perfect send-up of insipid topical  teen shows like My So-Called Life and the After School Specials that spewed conformist propoganda into the ears and eyes of America's youth every weekday afternoon during the 1980's.  I remember watching it back when I had cable, as well as a slew of other top-notch shows that were on Comedy Central at the time (Upright Citizens Brigade, The Daily Show, South Park, T.V. Funhouse etc...).  Strangers With Candy may not have been the best of these shows, or even the edgiest, but it very well may have been the darkest.  South Park and T.V. Funhouse were/are certainly caustic and dark, but 'Strangers' was pitch black.  This humor is truly without reverence.  Nothing is sacred, all is petty, and the mere concept of morality itself becomes the joke.

Comedy Central is truly a great network.  Whenever possible, complete creative freedom is given to (gasp!) the CREATORS of the show.  Strangers With Candy certainly benefitted from this policy; its vision is clearly uncompromised.  Every aspect of the production contributes to a consistent representation of a unified concept.

I recently rented the first and second seasons and the latter is the better of the two.  I am looking forward to renting the third season.  If you are a fan of black comedy, Strangers With Candy will tickle your funny bone - and then break it."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"Delivery Man... cute idea, ok script, still yet another Vince Vaughn movie,  If you like his acting is worth watching ONCE...  Predictable Hollywood box office hail mary pass"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"You get a mix of action, drama, suspense, etc.  If you've seen the anime, there's nothing I can think of that would surprise you.  Keep an eye on the price, I purchased this when it lowered from the $100s down to about $44.  The only complaint that I have is that the menu screen is a little hard to see because of the aqua background with white wording."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Great remake! It took me a couple of watches, but I loved the story and cinematography."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"High Noon is one of my husband's all time favorites. It's got some terrific lines in it. He's always quoting one of them. I bought this for his 71st birthday and he watches it at least twice a month. We like the fact that in the day and time this movie was made, foul language was unacceptable! Oh, that this was true today! It's a ""must see"" movie and worth every penny to buy it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"One of my serious all-time favorite movies. Good every couple years. LOVE Jeff Bridges, and the goofy humor, makes me laugh every time."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Fat Head does what Super Size Me failed to do; it entertained its audience, yes, but not at the expense of getting out its message. And the message is clear: we've been duped and had the wool pulled over our eyes for too long concerning nutrition in America. I was already familiar with the material prior to viewing this movie as I have read many, many books on the topic, but Naughton uses fabulous visuals that help to elucidate the finer points and clarify some of the muddier issues. Make no mistake, Tom Naughton is super smart as well as funny, and he has solicited the help of some of the best minds in the field of nutrition and medicine to show the public where Morgan Spurlock went horribly wrong in his conclusions. A must see film, and one that should be distributed to every library in the nation. I recommend it highly. Good Calories, Bad Calories(book) by Gary Taubes is a great companion piece to the film as it presents a lot of the scientific data that the film uses to make its points."
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,I'm a huge movie fanatic.  I've seen just about anything and everything.  I was so excited for this movie to come out because it's difficult to find a good horror movie that's not ridiculous these days.  Not only could I not follow this one nor did it hold my interest at all....but the plot was just poor.  I'm sure they were trying for something different here but I think it could have been better.  I wanted to give it one star but gave them an extra one for effort only.
Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,We found a cut place on one of the dvd watching it . It totally stop working. A one star rating they don't deserve even that.
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

Guide: F-bomb. Nudity."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Although Daniel Craig isn't my favorite Bond, this movie is well worth watching. Strong script, good acting, and excellent action make for an enjoyable 2hr 24min film.

My favorite part is the blast from the past in the last quarter of the movie... No spoilers here, but you'll know it when you see it!

Great way to spend an evening!

Highly recommended..."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Welcome to the world of Johnny Quid: London in flux between the old school fixers, new school Russian money, and petty thieves in between. Guy Ritchie takes you on a wild ride through the madness and mayhem that begins with the a shady real estate deal and never lets up. This perfectly paced piece of action adventure stars some great actors, including Tom Wilkinson who delivers an awesome performance. Everyone does a great job as they pursue their individual goals through a landscape studded with bizarre, yet linked incidents. Some of it is contrived, but all good movies are. Sit back, enjoy the ride and watch this movie at least three times to catch all the subtlety. Guy Ritchie is a brilliant director. I only wish he would make more movies."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Best of the X-men series by far.  I wish Matthew Vaughn had directed the first 3 of them too.  Almost enough to make up for the crapfest that was Brett Ratner's X-Men Last Stand.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I love westerns ..  Good entertainment . great movies  . She likes lonesome Dove so I thought  keep it going  .  We both loved it . highly recommend..
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Really great movie. Burton is at his best and the rest of the actors are as well. A well-measured approach to a perceived real world look at what being a spy must be like- true to form. Not much James Bond like action here but that isn't what this movie is all about. This is a character study that almost feels like a stage play: every scene is set and paced to take the viewer deeper and deeper into this hidden and bleak world.

  Viewing this film over Amazon prime was a treat. Although in B&W, it was very sharp and very close to true Blu-ray image quality. Of course with any movie enhanced by the Blu-ray process there is always something one never noticed before that catches the eye. In this case I couldn't help but be distracted by the small growth under Burtons right eye. It was distracting because I've never seen it before in his other films. But I guess every diamond has its flaw and IMO that was this the only thing I found about this film that I didn't like."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Wonderful setting to enjoy while you practice with Rodney.  He is a concise teacher that has really helped get my back in better shape.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"O.k so people your right this one doesn't measure up to other Disney animated classics like ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"", but then again maybe that is not such a bad thing.  Anyone remember the little disaster in-a-box from 1996 ""Humpback?"" No well then count yourself blessed and spared by the divine hand of God  It was bad.
This movie was not bad, not at all in fact I rather enjoyed it.  The storyline was solid if not wholly original and the graphics were great, sorta reminded me of Titan A.E only this movie got me to laugh once in a while whereas Titan A.E didn't.  The voice actors also seemed to have a fun time with what they were doing.
The thing that killed this movie and why it so poorly at the box office was just the shear number of Treasure Island movies out there.  I'm sure that if this move had been a wholly orginal idea it would have been a box office smash, but unfortunately it was not.
If you have the opportunity to but this one go ahead and do it.  This movie will surly keep both you and the kids interested.  On the plus side for adults the annoying singing is kept to a minimum"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"These two movies give Johnny Depp a great opportunity to show his acting range, and he doesn't disappoint.

""Sleepy Hollow"" is perhaps the definitive film version of this well-known tale, though it is not for the faint-of-heart. It gets pretty gory, what with the Headless Horseman out and about his business. We tend to watch this film around Halloween...then see if we can get over its ghastly images by Xmas.

I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway with Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and Victor Garber many years ago. Cariou and Lansbury were spectacular. Garber, not so much - Sondheim's music for the male ingenue role is pretty ungracious, and neither Garber nor Jamie Campbell Bower in this film version has any success negotiating the vocal writing.

Depp's film Sweeney is a great deal more-frightening and disturbed than what I saw on B'way. That's possible in large part because he doesn't have to project his singing voice and stage persona into a live theatrical space (truth is Depp's singing voice wouldn't project well into the open space of a typical B'way theater without major amplification). That makes for a more-intimate, more-human portrayal, and it's fairly disturbing. The rest of the cast is good as well.

Both films were directed by Tim Burton who seems to get the best out of Depp. The ""By The Sea"" sequence in Sweeney is particularly touching in fleshing out the human sides of Todd and Mrs Lovett that might have been in a way that just isn't possible in the staged version.

If you want to enjoy Sweeney as a disturbed horror flick, get this version. If your main interest is hearing the music, get the 1982 ""Tribute"" version with Lansbury and George Hearn.

Recommended (the price is certainly right - I paid only $10.86 with tax for both movies!), but not for the squeamish."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I am glad I bought this movie.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  Glad to add it to my movie collection.

it took me a few  minutes to try to clean all the crap that was on it to no avail.
luckily it played with no problem. but, it was as if a 5 yr. old kid had played with it, then dropped into the case.
don't think ill ever buy from this business again"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Who doesn't need the Rocky triligy for their dvd library?
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.

Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.

Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.

The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.

The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,A unique view how kids view the adult working world.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"For me, this movie captures all the magic and imagination of Walt Disney in a way few others ever have. I own this DVD myself and bought it for my daughter and my grandchildren. This movie is a true classic that I think never has received the acclaim it is due."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Love this for under the litter box! Makes cleaning a little easier
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Good and sturdy.  Guinea's don't knock them over - easy to clean.  Will break easily if not super careful in the sink.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Worked great, only issue is a close friend borrowed and kept it.  Buying 2 more, one for my yorkie and one for my deer-chiweenie.  Both like to bark, this will stop them.  Currently have to block the doggie door as they will run out barking at the wind, a bird, nothing, everything.  Neighbors complain.  Since I have to work, this is not an ideal situation.  I put the collar on during the hours I work, and off when not working, it was great.  I plan on putting the collar on during the hours I work and then again a couple hours later turned off.  I want them to not bark and not associate it with the collar."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,I have used this twice and so far so good!
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"My dog likes it and she's elderly.  I don't know that it actually makes a difference in her joints, she is a 3 legged friend and I'm trying to prevent any further discomfort or issues."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Amazing! I love it, and my guinea pig loves it. Only, it was sent to me with a broken ramp. I had to contact Super Pet."
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"Muzzle is made of nylon and completely washable. Adjustable with minimal buckles. Description says that it will help prevent biting, barking, and chewing while allowing panting and drinking. My dachshund figured out how to bark with it on. So, if you're wanting it for the non barking feature, I wouldnt count on it. However, it would combat biting and chewing."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,my older dog needs these & likes them. i mix 2 in her food every night. she is a 13 year old beagle.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,I use as a topping for their regular food as they love a little variety.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"So, at first I hated this thing. I purchased this for my Oceanic Biocube 29 HQI and I couldn't find a good place for it. I tried the display portion, but the Aqualifter wasn't powerful enough to fill the level correctly within 0 minutes, and the water level had to change at least two centimeters before it would even kick on. I felt it was useless. Then, I relocated the sensor into the 3rd chamber. With my Tunze 9001, it's really tight in the last chamber, but it does fit and it works flawlessly. The water level is topped off about twice a day now and my salinity is stuck perfectly at 35 ppt. I've had no errors with it and I like the many 'safety' features that the controller includes.

This is a good buy for those who want a low-profile level sensor with built-in redundancies to prevent malfunction."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Just purchased this cat tree a week ago. It arrived quickly and was better than I imagined. The cat houses were large enough for my adult cats. I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

When I purchased this cat tree I saw that there were similar trees for less money, but I chose this one by Armarkat because the reviews said it was sturdy. I must admit this cat tree was easy to put together and it is extremely sturdy. My cats jump on and off and climb it without any wobbling. I have two cats and both are about 13 lbs. The carpet material is a little on the cheapy side, but the cats enjoy it so I can't complain. I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cats are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground. I purchased the 74"" tree and was concerned it might not be tall enough to make the cats feel secure, but it's plenty tall and spacious too!

If you are looking for a sturdy tree that your cat/s will enjoy I recommend this product by Armarkat."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I've used these over the past several years, so have a lot of experience with them.  I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.  I literally (""litter-ally""!) don't know if I could've survived having cats without these and the Litter Genie!  Next step - toilet-training the cats."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,This was my third attempt to try and find a split leash for my two mini Aussies. It's light and very comfortable. It doesn't drag on the ground and the handle is cushioned which I wasn't expecting. Will buy from this retailer again when the need comes!
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside. Highly recommend this litter, especially for multiple cats!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"i got the exo terra one, its awesome, spend a lil more and do it right. your reptile will love your for it. there you go, i hope this helps."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"So fun, my dog loves these. Got a few different types of bottles. I cant help but laugh every time I see him walking around with a beer bottle in his mouth.
Would have been 5 stars but after about a month he chewed the caps off the tops.  Still got 4 because hes a 90lb American bulldog/pit that would have probably been able to chew the caps off if they were made of metal."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My cat loves this, and Id also like to add when using his litter box the smell has decreased. I will cont to purchase this product as well as other natural balance products for him.
I was having a hard time finding a dry food as well as a wet food he preferred, he hasn't turned his nose up to any of their products yet."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Great product.  Saves time, trip, and money from standing in line at Petco.  I and others I know will be back to order more."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,I purchased this package because the pads on the original filter is getting thinner and thinner. These pads are so much thicker and seems more durable. The four pads fit perfectly in my filter. I have not use the carbons as of today. I purchased them together because of the price and have these carbons as replacement in the future.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,My dog absolutely loves these treats!  Two paws up!
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Very good dog food.  Like the healthy components of it very much because i'm careful about what I feed my dogs.  The good news is, they liked it too.  recommended for those avoiding grains."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Great self-priming siphon vacuum! Perfect for my 5 gallon tanks!
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,Beautiful. But the embroidery gets snagged when she scratches. Not great for everyday wear.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"They changed the packaging and name. My dog is super picky, even with treats. He loves his vitamins!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,Required for MN 4-H for advanced obedience class.  My lab hated it.  He doesn't pick up.  I want to try to float it in the lake and have him get used to it that way.  It as fine.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Very happy with the results!  My dogs were with a pet sitter for a week and used our landing instead of going outside. I was horrified. I cleaned everything right away, but had to watch them like a hawk. I was afraid they would re-soil the area. They did a few times. I ordered this and went over every area of carpet in my home. It gave me peace of mind to find all the spots and treat them. They don't seem to be sniffing around the landing like they were. I still keep an eye on them on the landing, but I am feeling much more confident."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Great item. Doesn't work for all cats but that doesn't mean the product is bad. Some of my cats don't like catnip. Just know your cats.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I had been feeding my two Beagles raw Chicken for over a year which was fine in the beginning. Then my female Beagle suddenly got allergies. After two shots of Prednisone, two rounds of oral Prednisone (all spread out in a span on 6 months), and a change in diet (cooked Potatoes and Fish/Beef), she still had allergies! I started giving them Natural Balance Vegetarian and all her allergies instantly went away. They have been on it for two weeks now.

Since I felt they needed protein, I gave them 1/4 lb. of raw beef each last night. They both instantly started to itch! I also bought Yoghurt so I guess I will just stick to that for protein for now."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,I was using a competitor but switched to this to see. The way it was shipped was worth sticking with this. I have had other companies bottles leak everywhere or be slightly damaged. First bottle here was great. It's working well and my dog loves it. I don't notice a fishy smell but if there was he would love it even more.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum.
Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.

I hope you find this review helpful and think if you just give Cat's Pride Fresh and Light a try you will never buy any other brand again!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"According to my Discerning Pair fo Feline Creatures, ""This is, ""The Stuff !"""
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"These work great with our cat! She tends to try and scratch our leather furniture and wooden door frames, so these work wonders. Once she starts scratching the area, the sticky tape deters her and she quickly stops in the act, annoyed. While it doesn't stop the behavior, it certainly does its function well - 5 stars!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Crate was delivered promptly and packaging was in good condition.  The plastic pan is good quality and it was in good condition.  The only issues that I saw are the number of doors and the thickness of the wire cage.  The fact that this cage only has two door eliminates you being able to put two pups in or take two pups out of the kennel with ease.  You would have to remove the center divider.  The other potential issue is the lightweight gauge steel that the kennel is made out of.  Our two GSD pups get excited when we come home and jump on the kennel walls.  The walls are flex enough that the pups can actually open the side door when they jump on it.  For the price point though, this kennel was a really good deal."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My cat wouldn't get in the first one, so she got in this one!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"This might work for a small dog who stays inside but I needed this to keep the white coat clean of a great pyrenees.  It's very thin and did not fit the three tags.  If he runs through branches, this would have torn off the pouch.  I guess I will use clear nail polish on the tags to keep them from discoloring the fur."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,Do not order more than one box as Amazon does not take back even unopened cat food ...something to remember in case your cat does not like
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,Smells great!! Doesn't get up pee that well.. Didn't come with spray top for bottle..
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,We are taking care of an abandoned cat outdoors and I can tell you that this works perfectly! The water stays cold and there is no freezing - no ice at all. We've had quite a bitter winter this year. A lot of 1 digit and below 0 days and it works just great.
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"We were feeding this to our two puppies (Goldens) for the past 7 months. At first they seemed to like it okay and then all of the sudden the last bag of food they weren't interested in it at all. Matter of fact, as hungry as they were, they would leave their entire bowl of food, untouched all day long. Only at night would they eat a TINY tad, only enough to basically sustain life out of starvation. One of the puppies started looking thinner and mind you, these ""puppies"" are already between 60-65 pounds each so I know they had be hungry. I started doing my own research on the food to try to see if others were experiencing this behavior with their dogs also. While I hadn't been buying this food on Amazon, I was buying it at our local pet food store, I still feel compelled to let everyone know that consumer affairs has a lot of complaints about this food, with the same exact symptoms as a lot of people on Amazon have and the same as we had with our two puppies, refusing to eat and loose stools. I returned the last bag I had purchased from the pet food store today and replaced their food with ""Zignature"" limited ingredient dog food and let me tell you, these dogs tore it up!! As soon as I sat their bowls down they started gobbling their food up. No I am not an employee of Zignature or paid by the company, this is just my honest review. So if your dog's refusing to eat or only nibbling at their bowl of TOTW and have loose stool or diarrhea, you may want to think about changing foods. Look up the consumer complaints yourself."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Wonderful vest.  Comfortable, easy to put on, and my puppy who is in training to be a therapy dog loves it."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My dog has been using these for years. When the rubber goes, I buy new ones."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Great product -- well made -- easy to adjust and easy to put on -- I have a three year old, 90 lb Golden Ret and it works well (XL) -- Recpmmend"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Still holding up after a year with a tough chewer.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Oliver is a maniac for this thing. He's a triped and had a long tube thing, then we got this and he loves it even more. One end comes with a dangle toy attached but he ripped it off pretty quickly, I was able to sew it back on. One of the tubes is made from crinkle material which is awesome. Oliver loves to play in it, hang out in it, and take naps in it too. Great deal for this item. Cat games and toys cost 3-4 times as much in the pet stores."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"Beware!! I purchased this a year ago and just bought a second one. It's supposed to be the exact same item, but the new one is very flimsy and much smaller. I'm going to try to return it. I doubt this new version will hold up."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,My cats just love these and I love that they are one ingredient treats.
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"Too flimsy for a large iguana. It was like waling a St. Bernard with dental floss! He easily slipped out of it and I almost lost him; not to mention the tail smacks that I got, leaving red marks on arms and legs. Would NOT recommend this product for iguanas over 2 feet and/or iguanas that are aggressive and not socialized."
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"I was looking for a ball my collie couldn't destroy (she tears apart everything and has a special obsession with balls). This ball seems well made, but it is very large and not pliable enough to where she can pick it up. She pushed it around the living room for the first afternoon, but then gave up and never touched it again. I ended up bringing it over to a friends house for his much larger retriever and even she could barely fit this in her mouth. I ordered the 6-inch diameter ball and I suspect this would be great for a big dog with a large mouth, but didn't work for my dog."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"I have not yet shot with this scope, NOT YET MOUNTED.  1)  It took over 4 weeks to receive it from time of ordering.  2)  The whole scope was covered with dust.  3)  The objective lens had smear marks on it but cleaned with a microfiber cloth alright.  4)  When I took the lens caps off after the 4 day return policy had expired, much to my surprise I discovered that the objective lens tube AT THE END was FLAT for about 2 inches instead of round.  The tube is NOT flat anywhere at the objective lens itself, but at the end of the scope.  That is more than a drop - that is someone sending me a scope from China that was mis-manufactured and hoping I'd never take the lens cover off I guess.  Since I'm stuck with the flawed product, I will still try shooting long range with it and report more later."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Nice and light weight. Too small for my child with glasses tho.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I love this hoodie!  I wear it frequently, size is right, cool looking, and the price is right!  Good purchase."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Fits my 43 perfect and is a nice personal touch. Priced right, all gtg"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,So far so good..does a great job for 100yrd spotting and boat watching at beach
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I needed a soft silicone case to use so I could change the battery often.  This one fits, I would purchase again!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Comfortable inside he pants holster that fits my bodyguard 380 perfectly. I love how comfortable it is to wear, how secure my pistol is and the concealability it provides...would definitely recommend. I also have this same holster for my glock 27, perfect."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"As you will see in the attached image, I have thick thighs and a slightly big butt for my size but I usually wear a medium in compression pants, the smalls fit but are difficult to get into, but the mediums are usually perfect. This medium feels like an XS, and I had to squeeze my way in there. If I would have gotten a large it may have fit much better. I love the waist though, I have a small waist and usually high waisted pants don't fit well because of the size difference between my hips and my waist, but since these run a bit small it fits me well at the waist. I also like the feel of the fabric, its soft, and even though it stretched a bit when I put it on as compression pants do, the fabric didn't become see-through like some yoga pants sometimes do. I need to test that in the sun but so far so good. I included the shot for reference, as I find it helps me when buying clothes online to see real women wearing the clothes, and I can almost never find someone with my shape, so I hope it helps women with a similar body type. I received these pants at a discount in exchange for an honest review, however that did not affect my opinion of the product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"love the pants;;;;;great fit ,and great look,great price. they were comfortable through out my work out and I love the colors. I ordered myself another pair liked so much;;;;;;"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Not as good as a Boyt but like it for what it does.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Most reviews only had bad things to say about the on/off button.  Seems OK for me...  Overall a solid light!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I needed a fun and exciting way to workout while I am stuck in my ""ice palace"" during winter. Seriously my driveway gets too slippery to drive down so for much of the winter months I am stuck inside.

Zumba is fun, love the music and so does my one year old son who dances and tries to follow along with me.

Almost instant results happened for me. I started feeling better and happier after the first run through. I noticed weight begin to slip off little by little and suddenly I was at my pre baby weight in two weeks! I get that results like that are not too common, but stress was holding the weight on me and Zumba really helped my stress levels.

Fun and exciting. I am a big fan!!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Great for hiding the cash and cards that we need to have on us but don't want people to see.  Now just have to remember to go to a quiet and private place to use it instead of showing bad guys what we have and where we have it.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Seems to be more heavy duty than the version with an arm on it. I prefer this model.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Great product and a great seller...would buy again and likely will in the future.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Original fit bit wristband broke. This is been a great replacement. Great quality even better price.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I ordered 1 pair and  used them for the whole day. Having 4 surgerys on my fused ankle W/24
screws. They were so comfortable & look more stylish, than elderly looking compression socks.
I ordered 6 pair immediately. Great compression socks !"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"At a glance upon arrival I was a little worried. The shorts were tiny but it turned out they were a good fit. The material isn't thin and weightless, but its' a solid material that is comfortable. I like how the shorts go down towards the knee. I received a discount on this product through Amazon Review Trader, and the deal made it all especially worth it. Also, the shipment came on time."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Used it for the first time yesterday and it worked great.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Love this sight. It works great. Would recommend to anyone that needs a little red dot sight. Have it mounted on a 22 and its light and perfect. Can't say enough good about it!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bought the replacement mat as my old one had rotted from sun damage. I have never replaced a mat before and was a little worried. But no need to worry. It fit perfect for my 12' trampoline bought from Walmart a few years back, and worked great. Not too hard and not too soft. Perfect. I highly recommend this"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This is the perfect case to house the Minelab CTX 3030 Metal Detector! I purchased the angled bow case from Plano but at 20 lbs. it was way too heavy. So I tried this rectangle case and it is the Perfect fit for the CTX 3030. The detector does not slip around inside the case. The case is weather proof and rugged and with the adjustable screw in pillars one can make it into any configuration desired!
I couldn't be more pleased with this solid case."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"My front light got stolen the first day I put it on while parked at my gym so it's hard to say how well this works.
I actually purchased another straight away. I will just have to remember to take it off every time I hope it lasts a while. Now, on the replacement, I cannot really say how well it lights my way because it is flooding in Houston and I'm not riding. But, the seller sent an email to ask me to review (I do loathe this new practice, as I typically don't use such products that soon and I HATE getting extra emails-like I don't get enough already). For this practice I dinged a star just because I hate the reminder so very much. I rate my products in groups as time permits, not as soon as I get it. Ridiculous."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"6'1"", 159 pounds, cyclist build, ordered a Large. The jersey was nearly baggy but certainly wearable. The problem was with the bib shorts - the openings for the legs were so small making the shorts so tight to pull on that I fear the seams would rip within a couple rides. The shoulder strap material also isn't as robust as other similarly priced kits that I own. Mostly returning due to the size mismatch between the jersey and bib shorts."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,A lot of people who have reviewed this talk about the extenders not being attached securely enough.  I would have to assume something has been changed on the rack because mine did have a way to tighten the extenders.  I just installed this and put one of my axiom 45L panniers on it and it fit fine  I put this on my 2009 Surly Travelers Check and it seems to be sturdy I think it would hold a lot more than the listed 45 lbs (Not that you would enjoy steering your bike with anything more than that on it)  This is great for bikes like mine that did not have mid blade fork eyelets.  I would have prefered the steel Surly rack however that was 35 dollars more and the replacement fork for my Travelers Check would have been another 100 dollars.  To be clear I have not actually used this rack yet I just was stoked to find out that the rack is a lot sturdier than a lot of the reviews lead me to believe.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I love this bag.  No, seriously, I don't mean I like it.  I mean I am kind of emotionally attached to it.  It's the feeling you get from relying on a tool that is perfectly made.

Despite being pretty small to look at, this bag holds everything.  The main pocket is an ok size and can fit everything that needs to go in there -- 1 L water bottle, bike lock, keys, light jacket, wallet, phone.  The pannier pockets are enormous when unfolded and can fit everything I can throw at them.  3 L water bladder?  Sure, with plenty of room to spare.  Groceries, including a few bunches of flowers?  Yep, no big deal.  Plus there's a convenient handle on the top to tote it around.

Here is what I managed to fit in the bag on a recent shopping trip:
4 heads of cauliflower (!!), 6 bananas, 2 18-oz jars of jelly, 1 1-kilogram canister of yogurt, 1 1-lb jar of peanut butter, 1 1-lb loaf of bread, 1 1-lb bottle of vinegar, 1 1-lb box of spaghetti, ~2 lbs of brussel sprouts, 1 20 oz water bottle

The Topeak system is great and means I never have to worry about the bag falling off, no matter how rugged the pavement is, or mess around with bungee cords.

If I were to have any complaint about this bag at all, it's that it doesn't have a thing on the back that's designed for a bike light to attach to.  I've clipped my light to the cord in the back and used one of the clip things on the bag to stabilize it and it's fine, but it doesn't have a designed placement that keeps the light from bouncing out of position and not facing perfectly back.  But that's a super minor complaint about what is really a fantastic bag."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Trailer tows very well. It is light but heavy enough not to bounce around. The length seems just right for a stable ride as well.
Instructions were very good. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it came with LED lighting. I didn't use the lights that came with it instead upgrading to LED lights.
Handles two 50 pound Kayaks without any problem."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Exactly what I needed.  I am always losing my chargers.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"For the price I am not sure it can be beat. I have used it during several rounds and it is within a few yards of much higher priced range finders and GPS watches that my friends use. Pin lock will at times lock right on with the same reading each time. Other times, it will take a bit and give me a different reading each time but never more than 3-7 yards of variance. Different readings each time is a pain but I am not that accurate with my irons anyway so it is not a deal breaker for me. As long as this unit lasts I consider this a huge win."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Best production flipper money can buy.  Great execution, steel, action and aesthetics.  I really enjoy the titanium frame, it has a unique feeling.  This knife needed a few days for break-in, now it's lightning fast and flips to lock 100% of the time.  This is my third ZT.  I'm sure it won't be my last."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Nice bag, thinner than I expected but works out great for the low profile carrier. You can easily fit 2-3 rackets. With 2, you can also fit a can of balls and change of shirt. Side pocket conveniently holds keys, phone, etc. If you want a lot more room for clothes, more balls, etc, get a larger size bag. This one is perfect on the thinner side if that's your preference. Great looking bag and well made."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This is a great knee brace for doing any lifting that requires bending your knee.  It is way more secure than I thought it was going to be.  I usually use a knee brace that has adjustable straps, since I've experienced a lot of slippage with knee sleeves.  This however is an exception.  I did size down one to ensure a tight fit.  It is made of good material and is very sturdy. Most products from bear grips has great quality.  They obviously put a lot into the products they sell to their consumers.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Not the highest quality but it's worked fine for me and will be great for occasional use
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Took it shooting yesterday. Only took 6 rds to get it dialed in at 50 yards right out of the box!! The clarity outside in actual use was far better than what I thought while looking through it inside my house at night, from 3x all through 12x. The side parallax adjustment is great as well. I was able to ring steel at 200 with boring regularity, and it didn't seem to lose zero after 100 rounds of .308. Only complaint is that there is a little bit of distortion and the edges of the filed of view, but it's only noticeable if you intentionally look at the edges.

The illuminated reticle uses a light that washes all over the inside of the scope, not just on the crosshairs, so that is a bit of an annoyance, but I don't forsee myself using the illuminated reticle. Just putting that out for those that will.

The rings that come with the scope appear to be of phenomenal quality, every bit as good as the Warne rings I purchased for another rifle. There are 4 screws per ring that tighten around the tube, which I feel provides a far more secure mount.

I wish the rings positioned it a hair higher, but overall I am extremely pleased with the performance of the scope. Even more so considering for my $113 delivered to my door, I got a set of rings that seem every bit as good as the last 30mm rings I got from Warne for another AR.

I would say this would make a great scope for someone looking for a decent scope on a budget, especially considering it's a 30mm tube!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,These things are awesome! I teach fitness in doors and out doors and I can't always find something to attach my fitness bands to.  This makes it so much easier for my clients and for me. They are strong and durable.  I love that I can travel with them and that they come with a pouch to carry them in.  I did purchase these at a reduced fee for my positive review.  I'm very happy with them.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I'm gonna give you the begginers outlook. I am only on day 3. I've done kick boxing and football so I'm not out of shape in the sense of not working out. I've had 3 knee surgeries and have fractured my ankle on my dominant (right) side. My dad is a pastor and a physical therapist healing hands I guess is why he toon that route. Anyway so I always got in homehelp but my body has gotten stiff over the years with cartledge and joint discomfort. We are talking complete subluxation (dislocation) of my knee caps from the sockets. So when I say I feel it in my quads, my hams, and my knees you better believe it. I don't know how well it's gonna play out but we will see. I'm 300 pounds 6'3 and I ain't obese theres a tone of muscle  on me due to I got into weight lifting. Yes I know it's not great on my knees to add weight but I'm trying to build my legs as well. So far Tai cheng has proven to be the hardest leg workout I've done thus far. I also enjoy it he talks to you not at you which is hard considering he's on TV not in person. My dad has seen the visa and if you're wondering if Dr. Cheng knows his stuff take in consideration NY dad a physical therapist for 20+ years said it's simple but effective since it's trying to make your body work naturally."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,This is how all folding chairs should be made. You get four commercial grade heavy-duty chairs that look like they will last a lifetime. They are constructed from high-density polyethylene and have a powder coated steel frame. This allows the chairs to handle a sitting 400 pound person or a 300 pound person that is standing on it. I can tell right after unpacking them that they will be able to take a beating from heavy usage. They have contoured seats and backs. I noticed that they are so much more comfortable then the common all-metal folding chairs. I have sat in the Cosco chairs for over an hour with zero issues and I could have sat longer if I needed to.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"This rope is 30ft long and is thin, reflective and lightweight and packs up small. However, the biggest negative for me, and one of the reasons I don't use it much, is because it tangles up so easily. The reflective tape they have woven into the rope makes it tangle even easier than it normally would without the reflective material. But for $12, I'm not going to complain too much."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Excellent quality gloves! These fit both mine and my husbands hands comfortably and securely thanks to the Velcro wrist closure. We use these a few times a week with our punching bag and they've held up very nicely. No rips or tears and they have a good amount of padding.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I'm using it on the "" saw blade on my Delta 14"" floor standing band saw for ripping 1/2"" thick x 8' long oak strips. 1/2"" thick doesn't sound like much but it binds my 1/2"" blade in the middle of an 8-foot ripping - combination or underpowered motor and wrong drift angle on my part. Anyway, the stick works really well but doesn't last long as I had to constantly apply it even during the middle of ripping. Need to buy couple more sticks - use about 3"" of the stick after ripping about 600 feet of oak. An additional benefit seems like sawdust doesn't collect on the tires. Looks like the stick will save both tires and saw blade."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,There is a reason it is so inexpensive. It emits a loud buzz when a USB device is plugged into it. And it is so wide that it would be dangerous to install in a metal box or in any box with another device. Spend a few more bucks on a better product.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"At first, I thought it would be difficult or distracting looking through a screen mesh. But after the initial novelty wears off (maybe 2-3 minutes), I almost forgot I was wearing them.

I had to contact the seller as one of the screens was very discolored and was distracting when someone else was looking at me to talk (it had no effect on me looking out). They were AWESOME and sent out a replacement pair that day!  And THAT is what Customer Service looks like!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"How many times do you find yourself in the kitchen with a sharp knife and an unprotected hand?  I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

I'm a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"...and get prior verification from the seller that you will receive what is advertised, and not a lower quality ""knockoff"".

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Had issues with being outdoors and the unit not turning on.  Appears to have an issues with the battery compartment keeping water out when it rains.  I allowed the unit to dry out and it never came back on, even after several days of sunshine in an effort to see if it would charge.  Worked great up until the rain."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Smart design. Like the fact that the keyring is integral to tool. Issue I normally have with key chain tools is separating the tool from the key, a problem than this tool solves rather well. That said, I have barely used it, and much prefer  the leather-man squirt."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Wasn't too impressed with this, it was broken and I needed to return it. I did not reorder because o just wasn't impressed with the material or it. I figured if it was broken so easily when it supposed to be sturdy and strong there was no sense and re-ordering it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought this an an everyday carry light to keep in my pocket. This flashlight fills that role nicely. 120 lumens is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding items in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use as a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yards while medium power in excellent for situations where you don't need 120 lumens, such as walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for tasks such as unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe as I don't have much use for it.

The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasions and scrapes to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, as it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it clicks for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on.

Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light makes a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear.

Overall, I would recommend this light for everyday carry use because it is well thought out, built with quality, and above all else it is reliable."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"First pocket knife for our son, who is 11.  It made a great gift when he crossed over into Boy Scouts - he loves it!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This is the third generation of this device and each has been better than the last.  As you lengthen the measuring tape, the measurement displays on screen. Tap a button to save. Or convert measurements quickly (from fractions to decimals, or inches to centimeters, for example) and calculate midpoints (great for helping to hang a picture). And no need to bend the tape when measuring into a cornerjust select the  back of the device as the starting point.

However, I keep wondering what will happen if I drop this on the floor and that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.  I don't want to test that out and have mine malfunction."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Very modern looking and works well for small bathroom.  The sound of the fan is not bad.  Sure you can hear it is running, but it is not obnoxious noise.  I was painting the ceiling on a very cold windy day and there was no cold air blowing back into the bathroom."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,It does the job.  I hope it lasts better than my previous fixture.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"AWESOME !! I'm 6'2"", almost hits knees. Very sturdy,  thick. This will last me forever. Very nice quality."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Works well definetly better than using vice clamps to remove hose clamps
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Perfect for my arrow saw.  I can cut 24 arrows in one minute with perfect 90 degree cuts and no shredding.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Great to have mini file sets, for plastic modeling. Comes with 3 mini file sets. Flat, round, and triangular shaped files. Does a decent job at filing down rough edges or creating even holes."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"When I bought this it was under fifteen dollars, which is very reasonable for any sort of timer light switch product.  I installed it in my bathroom to control the exhaust fan and it works perfectly.  You need to know what you're doing in the junction box because all 4 wires need to be hooked up correctly (and there -must- be a white wire for power,) but it was not difficult and it looks nice along side the other switches."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"My wife and I love them, they came on time and were easy to work with. The remote works very well and has many lighting options."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I can not see why anyone would buy the cheap squares?

The people that design these squares did their homework and built a GOOD tool!!!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I'm very happy with this light! I used it to replace out old and outdated porch light. It was very easy to install and it works great! We set it up with a smart bulb so we can use Alexa to turn it off and on.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"It's hard to ""love"" an extension cord. But there's a lot to like about this one. Foremost, it's very flexible - which makes it easy to unwind, stretch out and rewind. Stiff extension cords are the pits. The plug lights up when power is present. Thought of this feature as a gimmick prior to purchase, but it's quite useful. The highly visible yellow color makes the cord easy to find in storage and spot when it's underfoot. Jacket is soft to the touch, but appears durable. Arrived quickly and in good shape. BONUS: It's made in the U. S. of A."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Color is good

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I never got this product from this vender.  CT Power Tools informed me within a day or two that the product was out of stock and they were uncertain how soon they might have it, that it was probably going to be a month or two. I canceled the order and resourced it.
I would and probably will do business with this vender again as I very much appreciate their timely responses and honesty."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Looks great and fits well into old standard sink basin. The top does look much larger than the usual bathroom sink drain, so if you don't like that large size, look elsewhere.  My sink wasn't the most cosmetically appealing anyway, so the large drain improves the look considerably. Attached are the before/after pics."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Very Good light! Nice size not to big not to small. Bright, excellent light for the money. Looks like it will last a long time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,You get what you pay for and this should work just fine for its intended purpose.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works better than expected and pockets, lots of pockets bot inside and outside the bucket.  Its a little tight on my homer bucket andi don't know If my bucket is taller than other 5 gallon buckets or Im using it wrong but I have about 4 inches of clearance before reaching the bottom of the bucket and unlike in the photograph.  Yeah, I recommend this to everyone and its even better than the bucket liner I got from the Home D."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Wow, what a great little flashlight that packs a punch.  This thing is way brighter than my LED flashlight with 4 LED's and I love the adjustable spotlight.  It puts out a nice big round spotlight depending how near or far you are."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Is there a reason to NOT love a Mora?
This is just as it appears to be in the photo & stats.
Mora is synonymous with ""consistently great affordable knives"" and this one in particular is no exception.
Because of it's narrow, short blade, and high Scandinavian grind, this basic wood carving knife is perfect for carving.
One of the reasons most wood carving blades are short is for control of the blade, enabling the holder to make precision cuts, and requiring the user to take their time with small cuts, rather than large sweeping ones.
In all other ways, this is a standard Mora knife."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This has to be the all time greatest ladder built, you will not be sorry if you buy it, I would not be caught with out it"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,Don't really hate it. Would give it 3 stars I just read the worst reviews first because of the flaws. If I had longer wrenches this would be ideal. 14 pockets but the wrenches sink in the pockets. Material seems very sturdy to give it a long lasting feeling. Corner edge is to long for regular 17 inch deep tool box but the extra space just folds up. The 5782 was a way better fit for everything.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This a decent bag. It's the right size for the tools I have. The shoulder strap was what made this the winner over similar bags. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have internal pockets. Otherwise, I am satisfied with this purchase!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is a great quality hole punch at an awesome price!  It does just what it should do--of course don't overload it with paper, but it does about 10 pages very comfortably.  I bought it for random handouts I get in school and want to keep in my binder.  Serves the purpose well.

I would definitely buy this again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Shank on one lock bent during first use!  Otherwise, the locks seemed to work fine.  Easy to program your own combination code and locks feel strong and heavy-duty.  But the shank should not have bent so easily.  In fact, the lock was completely open when we picked up the suitcase from baggage claim at the airport.  There was no other damage to our luggage.  A strong, safe lock should not be able to be bent so easily."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Lots of light for where you want it without having to wire a light so the convenience factor puts it high on my list. But it seems very cheaply made so I will see how long it lasts.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I use these cause I have to wear long sleeve shirts to climb telephone poles.  Most of the time its too hot and I wear short sleeve shirts and just put these on when I have to climb.  They work great and are better than a shirt cause they are pretty thick and protect against the small splinters..
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"First of all. Its case looks so ugly and cheap that I must warn you i you want to use it in any professional setting or regularly. It looks like an elementary school pen case . Why is it yellow and blue? any aesthetics?

Secondly, while all the parts works fine, it lacks one crucial component for apple stuff repairs: A plastic pryer. The tweezer coming along with it is definitely the worst in its class and useless for prying anything. To have to triangular pryers makes no sense.

On the other hand, the exchangeable screws works find and oiled properly. For this price I would rather buy ifixit toolsets at least it looks better for an Apple product..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is a nice heavy reliable abrasive saw. Good vice, good bearings, good guards. This is a workhorse. For lighter gauge steel cutting I made my own chop saw. Check it out - [."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Best tool ever used for crimping wire ferrules
I love this tool worth the money"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Cool old timey knife. Open easy once adjusted. Came very sharp out of package.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Wow! Very easy to install and easier to program. I bought one to control my front porch lights and after two weeks I decided to buy a second for the rear door.  It comes preset to turn lights on at dusk and off at 11pm.  All you need to do is set the time and your coordinates (table is provided) and you're set! I don't have to come home to a dark house anymore. Quality of the switch seems top notch and it looks very nice installed. Very happy with purchase!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"today helped one of the guys at work put up posts for his fence in the back yard.  i brought this to help with a straight post line.  the area for the posts was not level, in-fact it was lumpy and bumpy.  for he said he will level the yard after the fence is up.  so i folded down the little feetters , turned it on and right away saw the red laser line.  we augered the holes via per the lazer line.  put the posts in the holes and poured the cement.  after the posts were setting, we used another lazer to see how accurate this was.....DEAD ON....  this work buddy has such a straight fence line that his neighbor came over and asked if we could set his posts for his fence.  this is easy to use and no matter what terrane it sits on you will get a perfect straight line.  this really beats using the older lazer level.  since it is made by bosch you can be rest assured that the quality is in the product."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This was GREAT!  My son was able to lube all his Rubik's cubes.  Now all teh cubes are speed cubes -- and my husband loves it too!!
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Bought for my daughter's birthday. She put the outfit on her American Girl doll right away and loves it.
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,The price for the tablecover isn't too expensive but that definetly shows in the product. They served their purpose but they were nothing special
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"im glad i bought this toy. it does alot when learning #'s, abc's, shapes. this toy is very helpful. dont leave it on without use because u'll run the batteries down. but very useful and fun!!!! not 2 complicated."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Both of my sons really enjoy this toy. The Cyberex is one of the best parts, but it is also really fun that you can lock a bad guy, or Batman, in to the stomach cage of Cyberex, which is also a great place to store Batman when you are done playing!
When Batman rides on his back, you can push on a button under Cyberex's tail that makes a top part pop up and you can push a button to get red discs to shoot out at the 'bad guys"" which is a big hit with both boys, and is easy enough for even my 3 yr old to work on his own. It springs together nicely after you are done shooting the discs out and stands up without falling over or tipping like some toys do. You can push Cyberex's head down and tilt him up or down, which helps with aiming your shooting discs. We like that the Batman symbol is the end of Cyberex's tail, tying in Batman to the dino looking toy! Over all, it is very well built and has become one of the ""go to"" toys in our household for the boys. We recently had a party and some boys, around the age of 5, were very drawn to it immediately! I like the bright blue coloring with the sliver and gold since it makes it look more robotic. Batman is the perfect size! It is a very fun Batman toy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a gift! We did receive it from Mattel as part of a Rate and Play review but it has been one of the most played with toys we have reviewed!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Nice, relatively easy puzzle for 4-year old.  Does light up in dark!  Very fun"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Puzzles used to be something we did during our vacations at the ocean.  We liked to go in the off season to watch the storms and we'd always have a puzzle to work on.  When I received the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vintage-Vacations-2000-Piece-Puzzle/dp/B006ROJPD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vintage Vacations 2000 Piece Puzzle</a>&nbsp;it brought back memories of these vacations and I was excited to start the puzzle.

First I had to find an open surface that was large enough for the puzzle.  I had hoped our card table would work, but it was too small.  I ended up putting it onto our kitchen table for the time being. As the description states it's 38.5"" x 29.5"", so not a small puzzle by any means.

Upon opening the box I was impressed that all of the pieces were contained in a plastic bag. When I cut it open and dumped them it to the box, I could see the quality of the pieces. These are very solid pieces, that do not bend easily and the edges were clean.

My daughter and I started putting it together the best way we know how, by doing the border first. This meant sorting through 2000 pieces, but it really makes it easier to start.  Once we had the border done we sorted the pieces by color and that is one of the things I really enjoyed about this puzzle. The colors were great! Vibrant, glossy and the different areas were pretty distinguishable.  Within a day we were at least a 1/4 done, two days later it was 1/2 done and by day four it was complete.

I think what I enjoyed most about this puzzle was the time spent sitting with my 18 year old daughter who is so busy these days, that we rarely see each other. She was so interested in it, that I would find her doing it at all hours.

Overall I was impressed with this Ravensburger puzzle and I'd recommend this one or any of their many others. They are great for your family and nice enough for gift giving too."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,works well for an inexpensive toy. We flew through batteries though.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I really like this set. I had REALLY wanted Eris the eagle,and now I got her. Once,I even brought it into the car!!!But it dropped. Not such a good idea. It really looks like an eagle too.(used it for a legend beast once!)The little raven flyer was pretty neat. I think it was among my first chima sets. I like the missiles. I like the detachable cockpit too.it IS a great set."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Love this.  We are doing My Father's World Exploring Countries and Cultures this year for our homeschool and this globe is perfect.  To top it off, this will be a permanent piece in our home even when we're not doing school."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Got if for the in-law, he has fun with it, and its a good party entertainer"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I bought this for my daughter, who is eight years old and interested in robotics. It took about an hour for her to put it together, and she was so proud of her robot when she was done. I liked that it was easy enough for her to build by herself, though she did need a bit of adult assistance to tighten some of the screws. The robot is very cute and it works perfectly. I have since bought her a few other 4M robots as Christmas gifts (which she has not opened yet) because she had so much fun building this one."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This looks exactly like the witch in the Room on the Broom book and DVD!  It has the official tag saying it is a Room on the Broom character!  My grandson will love it for Christmas!
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,Son loved. white changing marker ran out earlier than expected
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I was very surprised by this. It's very sturdy and the quality seems to be better than you would expect for something you paid $14 for. My husband blew it up with his mouth and had no issue. My kids have bounced both indoors and out and its neither showing any signs of wear and tear, nor is it filthy. I would purchase this again for sure."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Our three year old loves this T-REX! Lots of imaginative play! Well made toy and fun!
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,I love all the puzzles by Melissa and Doug!  They're all wooden and well made and my son loves them!
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"I ordered this item assuming it was the Real Bananagrams. I was sent a cheaper ""take-off"" of the real Bananagrams game. There was no trademark for the game on the storage bag - which the original version of the game has. I compared the true Bananagrams at a local toy store and the version I was sold here was a cheaper take-off on the real product. The storage bag was cheap, thin material with lose threads. The true version of this game has a nice quality storage bag with the trademark on the bag.

The instructions actually had words that were spelled incorrectly - funny as this game is about spelling.

Just beware you might receive a cheaper ""take-off"" version of this game when ordering from this supplier.

Disappointing and also dishonnest to sell it this way."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Love these Rescue diecast trucks. They are as described and be a wonderful addition to my collection.
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"I usually buy Ravensburger puzzles, but I liked this vintage seed packets picture so decided to give White Mountain a try seeing as it had good reviews. Sadly, the quality wasn't very good. Lots of hanging chads, ripped backings and pieces which were still joined together. On the corner of one piece, the picture was beginning to lift up off the cardboard. Not traditional shaped puzzle pieces - various angles and sizes throughout the puzzle. The pieces are larger than usual - good for someone with impaired vision. Not that challenging - easily completed in an afternoon. Personally, wouldn't buy again, but a nice picture if you had to buy puzzles with larger pieces."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Hence, some parts not fitting well like elevator, but love the flat screen TV built in for cell phone."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Very cute. Maybe not 100% the quality I wouldve liked, but perfectly acceptable for the price."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I believe I bought this set from Amazon when my son was 3, and it was the best investment I ever made!  If I had known how great these cups were, I'd have bought them at the beginning.  I've tried every brand out there, and these are by far my favorite.  They do not leak if you take the time to tighten them properly, and I give 10 stars to the spillproof parts...all others I've tried are impossible to really clean properly, and you end up having to replace those parts repeatedly if you lose track of a cup and have it get yucky.  I love these cups because all of the portions of the spillproof apparatus come completely apart so you can sterilize all the parts sufficiently before reassembling the cup.  I put the parts in a compartment of my dishwasher and use the sanitize cycle.  My son rides a school bus with me all day, and he was in the habit of slinging his cup of milk to watch the dribbles land on the walls and seats.  This made for a huge stinky mess to clean up.  He would do the same thing on long car trips in my personal vehicle when he was bored.  I'd have little white dots all over my windows and seats.  I bought these cups in the hope that they would *TRULY* be spillproof, as in he would no longer be able to ""sling"" milk from them.  Alas!  He can't do that with these cups!  I LOVE THESE!  I highly recommend them."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"Bought it as a gag gift so I did not expect it to do much, but it broke immediately upon trying to pick something up with it"
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"The doll is very well constructed with nice feeling ""skin"".  Some of them have a slippery feel but this has the nicer feeling skin.  The clothing is very pretty and my 5 year old granddaughter tester loved the way the skirt pops out and gives a different look.  You have to use your hands though to put it back down.

One problem I noticed is that the doll cannot stand up and there is no stand to put it on.  It is also a ""display"" sort of Barbie which has to continue wearing the same clothing so the absence of a stand is confusing.  For the 5 year old it is enough that she is pretty but older girls might want a way to display her."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"Okay first off this is not a LOSi product quality bash review because we all know LOSI makes quality cars. This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else. The cool thing about this car is that it's a hobby grade car which means you can upgrade it with metal parts and better upgrades if you wish. So if your willing to spend the money to do that then by all means buy the car and have fun with it."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I had first seen this toy at a local pharmacy and almost bought it right then after seeing how great it was, but then I decided to purchase it off of Amazon as it was cheaper!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Kid really likes these Smart Toys games - travel and full size.

Pros:
1) A travel game with fairly strong magnets
2) A cute penguin theme

Cons:
1) There is no place to store the unused magnets while the child is trying to figure out a solution - they just fall all over the car floor or lap. What might fix this is to have both sides be magnetic: one side - game board, one side - staging area. And put the game options on harder cardboard that flip out the top and bottom.

2) The solutions. I wish they were somehow hidden or in another section. I've worked with my kid on ""it's not as much fun if you don't figure it out on your own"" but once he figured out that the solutions were in the back - he just spent his time copying the solutions. I don't even know how to address this one - I gave him to toy to entertain him while we were setting up and breaking down camp and for the car, in lieu of a screen, so I couldn't sit there and play with him."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"such a fun card game, so easy to learn, and each game lasts 15 mins.  its a lot of fun watching people play with you as you try to not get the exploding kitten card.  plus there are a lot of cute little  cards that just make you laugh while playing.  again super easy to learn and super fun to play"
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"The worst finger paint! It's incredibly thick and fairly hard to use. But worse, it's so difficult to wash off and (at least temporarily) stained my daughter's hands! I think highly of M+D in general but they should be embarrassed by this."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I was really excited to find this. For years I have been struggling with puzzle storage this is genius. Fits thin or thick wooden puzzles no problem! Keeps them together, organized and helps prevent lost pieces! Must have if your little one loves wooden puzzles wish I would have discovered this years ago!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My daughter received a few dolls for her second birthday, and she likes this one the most.  She prefers teddy bears, and it could be it is very similar to teddy bears; more than the other dolls.  She also likes the magnetic pacifier that comes with it."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My granddaughter does not let the bus out of her site.  I would recommend the Calico Critters for all toddlers.  I started her with them at 2 and she is five now and still plays with all of them.  The house and all the stores you can get makes a great little town for them.
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Great swings, but they did not come with quick clips to attach to swing set.  Make sure you order/purchase those too or you may have some disappointed kiddos at the playset!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Very nice set of pencils, they color beautifully in adult coloring books, especially for very intricate coloring.  However if coloring larger areas, they do take a lot more time to blend so start/stop lines are not visible, but it can be done.  (I'd recommend using Primascolor pencils for coloring books with mermaids, fairies, ect...)

I tested them against Crayola, Prang, Rose Art, and Prismacolor Soft Core Pencils.  They color so much smoother  than the Crayola, Prang, and Rose Art.  They definitely are not a replacement for Prismacolor pencils, they are still a step below them.  The pencils sharpen very nicely just using the Prismacolor Scholar sharpener (it's the green one).  Where as for my Prismas I have to use the black sharpener.

I have the 72 pencil set, about 20 of the colors are very close to each other, almost duplicates even.  It could of easily been a 48-50 pencil set if they rearranged the colors included in the 48 pencil set they offer.  I did purchase the metallic 12pk set as well which I'm waiting to be delivered.  I found a color chart online, and modified it to included which pencils come in the different sets.  I've included the pictures in my review."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Simple mechanics with fast-flowing turns lead to quick games. Two ways to win, and a set of movement options shared by both players throughout play."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Kids enjoyed building the toys, and had minimal frustrations, but there is little fun after the initial build.  It does not necessarily encourage free thinking and creativity nearly as much as other building toys, but it is a good starter set for that type of thinking.  After done, you are kind of stuck with two big toys that don't do much beyond standard toys that are already built.  Not knocking it really, but just how my kids work.  I think at this price, there should be more creative thinking."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"Our seven year old likes it.  It does seem a bit flimsy, though."
Toys_and_Games_5,2,OR,Nice wrap for cheap plastic parts. the stand bearly stands by itself. Would def avoid buying it.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"The Weebles were a bigger hit than I expected with my 2.5 year old granddaughter. I expected my 11 month old grandson to be the one playing with these toys since they are chunky and easy to hold onto. But my granddaughter played with these characters putting them in and out of a Weebles playhouse that I had from long ago. She just kept saying, Weebles wobble but they don't fall down!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Maleficent is another fun figure from the Disney Infinity line.  She has some good, powerful moves and plays well in the toy box.  My little dude is working on leveling her up to see what other moves she has along with unlocking her flying (hopefully) ability.  The figure also really looks like an animated version of Angelina Jolie."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Update: Note that this is an episode 7 version. Revell released a new version (Last Jedi) in 2018. The new model comes only in black & orange paint version and has a pilot & booster (see the pics). The size of the BB-8 unit & sound effects are also slightly different.
---------------------
I've got 6 Star Wars Build & Play models for my 4 Y.O. boy so far. I think this one is one of the first models in the Build & Play series. While all the others I've got have both ""light"" and sound effects, this one (and the other X-Wing with black & orange camo) has sound effects only. The sound effect is also not as cool/laud as some others (TIE fighter sounds the best IMO). Nevertheless, you can't skip this one if your kid wants a Star Wars Build & Play model I guess. One good side of this is that this one has a little higher chance to survive in your kid's hands, compared to the Level 2 X-Wing from Revell. The Level-2 X-Wing lasted a week or so (My son is extremely cautious when handling his toys) before its super thin laser cannons shafts were bent and some parts fall off. I don't see any advantage of buying Level-2 X-Wing over this one. This Level-1 model looks as good as the level-2 X-Wing.

Compared to other Build & Play models, this and the other X-Wings are exactly the same except for the color. The difficulty is on the low side. If you want to introduce this series to your child before the recommended age (8+), this can be a good starting point. You may also want to try TIE Fighter or Millennium Falcon. I wouldn't start with AT-AT though."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,Good toys but they were smaller than I was expecting
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,Only reason i gave it a four star instead of a five star is because the box smelt of ciggeret smoke an the box looked like someome tryed breaking into. (This is rite after the ups guy droped it off to me so i no it wasent a neibor trying to steal.) The dolls seems to be okay. i no my fouryear old will still loveit an be excites but i do wish the packaging wasent so juunky looking
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This is the one you I can say I got my money's worth. My son plays with it alllllll day long. He loves it. The neighbor kids love it. Everyone thinks it's cool.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This wonderful little bus is perfect for youngsters who are approaching school age to get them excited about various school activities like riding the bus. It has quite a variety of phrases and music built in, which you activate by rotating the bus sign to different destinations and swapping out the animals in the driver's seat which you press to play a phrase.

The bus is very sturdy, with doors that open and a fold-down picnic table. The batteries are already included and installed which is a big plus. I also like the easy connectors used to attach the toy, which make it easier to remove from the box than many kid's toys. Over all, a great toddler toy."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,Cheap quality. Several pieces broken.  Extremely unhappy with this purchase
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My daughter is obsessed with Paw Patrol. She has all of these plush pups and carries them EVERYWHERE we go. Seriously. These pups are pretty small so don't expect a huge stuffed animal. I was a little surprised at the size because of the price, but it's a licensed character so yeah. The size is perfect for my 3 year old though. It fits perfectly in her hands and arms.

Like I said, my daughter takes her pups everywhere and sleeps with them each night. She has had this pup for almost a year and it is still holding up great! She's pretty dirty, but with a little cleaning she looks as good as new. I always spot clean her with a little water. I am impressed with the quality of the materials. I am shocked that they have not gotten holes! This makes the price a little more worth it!

Your child will love this plush pup!

If this review has helped you, please click yes below that is has been helpful!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"You can play this just to have fun, and accidentally ""cheat"" often, or you can be more serious and just try to get a high score. This game is extremely simple to learn, explain, set up, and play. It's color-blind friendly: there are small symbols on each suit to help tell certain colors apart (in the dark, blue and green look similar and sometimes so do white and yellow). It's also very inexpensive compared to other card-based party games."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My daughter had a strawberry shortcake one for her party that we hung it up in her room like a giant poster. We didn't get this for a party we got it for my sons room. He is a super hero fan and I loves it as much as my daughter loves hers.
