Books_5,5,OR,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Double Fudge"". . . This book once again focuses on the book's main character Farley Drexel Hatcher (B.K.A. ""Fudge""). He is absolutely hilarious in this book. His obsession with money, his twin cousins and their little brother nicknamed ""Mini"", along with their parents are another interesting twist in this story. Peter Hatcher, Fudge's  older brother, who is now an official ""junior high school student"",  typically experiences all of the anxiety that is associated with  early adolesence.
This book made me laugh and laugh, especially the reaction of Mr. Hatcher when he discovers that their his cousins  want to stay at their house longer than a week.
I was also able to put myself in  many of the situations and generally grasp a feel each of the characters.
The first book that I ever read in the Fudge series was ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing"" followed by ""Superfudge"". I can remember attending Jefferson Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas waiting in line for what seemed like an infinity, to have first bid on checking out that book. I became a ""reader beaver"" thanks to Judy Blume and the wonderful staff at Jefferson Elementary who encouraged all students to build their foundation through reading. I used to walk swifly through the library with the rest of my classmates running straight towards the ""B"" fiction section --shouting, ""Ready or not here I come.""
This is an excellent read, and it is authors like Judy Blume who grasp the interest of young readers by  making her work interesting and identifiable to young readers. Thank you Ms. Judy Blume for providing great reading material for children of all ages!"
Books_5,4,OR,I understand this is the beginning of a new series. I will read the next book but the start is not as good as the Odd Thomas series.
Books_5,1,OR,"Up to now, the only things Bill O'Reilly have ever been good at are weak-minded thought manipulation and noise pollution, but now he has another box to tick off on his resume: he can write humor. Unintentional humor, that is. You see, the garbage that is ""The No-Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America"" proves that even on the page, Bill O'Reilly shines through as a complete hypocrite, and a horrible, horrible writer. It's so bad it's funny. Or it would be funny if people didn't actually listen to and believe this man.

You can see it in print as clearly as on his shows: this guy pulls words out of the mouths of the people he interviews; he bullies them with his stupid questions that are engineered to cater to his own views... And he is never after the truth, because the truth is a gray area and he only sees in black and white. Because he grew up rich and went to a boys' private Catholic school, he likes to think of himself as some kind of supreme arbiter over everyone. People like him are the reason many people think of the USA a ""bratty teenager of a country"". If you are looking for a book that is ""Fair and balanced"", this is most definitely not it. And really, I am not overly into politics, but I know that by supporting this travesty of a man and his pushy attitude the United States of America is sending the world the wrong kind of message."
Books_5,5,OR,"This book, if possible, is even better than the first book, The Passage.  I love the twists and turns and I can't put it down.  Can't wait to see what happens in the last book of this trilogy."
Books_5,3,OR,Interesting premise which moves fluidly thru place and time but almost too fluidly. The ending feels as if there was a deadline to meet. I give it a 6 out of 10
Books_5,5,OR,"This is by far my favorite version of Beauty and the Beast. I like that the family love one another instead of the usual not so loving family that frequently is written of.
I also adore that Beauty has her horse with her and that her passions are books and horses.
This is an incredibly well written book and I highly recommend this as an addition to your library of fantasy tales!"
Books_5,5,OR,"I absolutely adored those novel! ! Its amazing! !enticing'! Sexual!! And I love Gideon.& Eva!!
This story is definately better Imo than 50 shades since its being compared ...however
this writer knows.how to tell a story !!
I cannot wait for book 2 & this relationship makes sense! !
Five stars:::a stunning love story. With an amazing sex life to boot!!
I prefer this to 50 shades;-)!! Read it k lol"
Books_5,3,OR,"Macy is bored of all the pitiful looks she receives due to her fathers death a year earlier. She and her mother have been getting along fine, just fine, on their own. Her mother constantly works, and Macy helps her by sticking to their routine and keeping a perfectly clean house. Shes content with her perfect boyfriend and perfect grades and perfect life. That is, until a hectic catering company enlists her help at one of her mothers work parties. She then realizes how exciting chaos can be and how interesting real friends are. I read this book for my Read-a-Thon at school and I finished it in the day. It contains some serious issues, but overall its an airy read. The issues aren't heart-wrenching nor are they abnormal, so the book is easy to relate to. I could complain about its predictability or sappiness, but The Truth about Forever is defintely a book about the journey. It doesnt matter that the reader knows within the first chapter that Macy will fall for the gorgeous catering guy, Wes. Or that the book will have pages about finding yourself, realizing happiness, and moving on. I knew coming into the novel this wasn't a heavy book, which is why I enjoyed it. Its entertaining, and thats why I like Dessens books. Always, she writes books that serve to entertain and relate to teens. I flipped happily through the pages, never bored, but never thrilled either. The characters are fun and normal and don't have anything special about them. Her books are so realistic. The world isn't going to end and the characters don't have anything life altering happen to them. She somehow writes about ordinary days but still engages the reader wholeheartedly. The Truth about Forever is a cute romance between two teens trying to find themselves. The plot isn't extraordinary, but the writing style and characters really make the book. Compared to the other Dessen books Ive read, this one isn't as good, but I still found myself entertained while reading it. More book reviews at Stealingpages."
Books_5,2,OR,"Initially interesting and great insights but ends up being one more endless recount of the trashout days. By comparison, Keith Richards' ""Life"" has the breadth, scope and below-the-surface insight that writers should be targeting. I personally lived and drank and drugged my way thru the 60s and 70s. And still enjoy a good tale of those days. But ...."
Books_5,4,OR,"I was alit bit worried when i bought the book because their was so many bad reviews on here... but i have to say that iliked it.  I hate that everyone is trying compare it to Twilight.  I am one of the few people i know that didn't like twilight but loves vampire books.  Yes. there is a twist.  yes. i figured it out before they actually came out and told us, but i like the way that it was done. i think it makes the book different.  It is a fast read. nothing really deep about it but its a fun 'coming of age' vampire story"
Books_5,5,OR,"I LOVED THIS BOOK !
A GREAT STORY, SUCH STRENGTH SUCH A GOOD MAIN CHARACTER. BUT MOSTLY I LOVED IT BECAUSE OF THE TRUTH OF THE ORPHAN TRAIN STORY.
I ALSO GENEALOGY RESEARCH AND THIS JUST BLEW ME AWAY.
SO MANY FAMILY STORIES HAVE BEEN LOST BUT CAN BE FOUND.
GREAT BOOK I READ THE ENDING 3 TIMES
IF YOUR IRISH YOUWILL LOVE IT EVEN MORE"
Books_5,5,OR,"This is by far one of the best books ever written.  It follows a love story for a lifetime.  It does not say that all in life is perfect as long as there is love.  It lets life happen.  All the little details that we sometimes choose to ignore have consequences.  It proves that the heart wants what the heart wants.  Every emotion is thouroughly covered with honesty, dignity, joy and pain.  Everyone should read this book as well as A Hundred Years of Solitude by this author just for the beauty in the words.  I loved both of these books."
Books_5,5,OR,This series is AWESOME!!! I love this series and can't wait for each new installment. And the narration is excellent.
Books_5,5,OR,"All of Alexandra Day's Good Dog Carl books are wonderful books to share with children, but this one is my favorite."
Books_5,3,OR,"Have read all eight books and feel these people are a part of my family. I think the author wasted way too much time and detail on fillers in this book though while hurrying over the parts that the reader wanted. I won't spoil it for others by detailing my thoughts. Still glad I read it and will read number 9, if and when it's released."
Books_5,5,OR,I love this series.  This is the second time I'm reading it.  I found the characters of Richard and Kahlan were so well described that I actually found myself missing them - so decided to read the entire series again.
Books_5,4,OR,I enjoy this author and I particularly like the light hearted Chrstmas stories.  THey add to the happiness of Christmas and take one away from the bussel and hecticness of ones presnt duties.
Books_5,5,OR,I am in love with this series! I couldn't put this one down and thankfully I started it on a weekend so my work didn't get in the way! Ms Thayne did a wonderful job depicting a romance which blossomed from friendship. How refreshing to read a book not caught up in today's recipe of girl meets boy and has sex at the first opportunity. I can't wait for the next one!
Books_5,5,OR,"Year of the Unicorn is my favorite Witch World novel among the many five-star novels in this series by Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton (Alice Mary North).  Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey  the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.

The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were pack.

Year of the Unicorn is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Nortons Witch World. Unicorn veers away from the mainstream WW adventures of the Tregarth family (Witch World, Web of the Witch World, Three Against the Witch World, etc.), but it is perfect in its own setting (the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack), and in its own right."
Books_5,5,OR,"So I had been behind on this series.  Then I binged all of them over last summer.  So when this book came out - I was way more than ready.  Charley and Reyes, omg, right?  I'm really late on this review, but here I am.  Better late than never!

I'm terribly sad that this series is winding down.  I heard there is one more book, but I don't know.  I am hoping there is.  But even then, I don't think it would be enough.

The series in general involves all of the things that I love.  Supernatural things, a badass woman, and a sexy dark man.  And the humor is top notch.

I don't want to give spoilers away, but the big secrets just keep coming out.  I don't know how Charley and Reyes will get through everything.  And this book in particular had some really heartbreaking things happen.  Let's just say at the end, there were tears.  Big fat sloppy tears and I feel like a big part of the heart of it all in this world Darynda Jones created will be forever bruised.  And then, as per I've become accustomed, the story ends with a BANG! and I'm frantic to read the next one.

If you've made it to the 12th book in this series, there's nothing I need to tell you.  You know Darynda Jones can create a world and make it revolve like nobodies business.  If you haven't gotten to this book, then you definitely need to."
Books_5,4,OR,I always try to guess who or what and never get it right. Great reading.  Always enjoy Patterson.
Books_5,5,OR,I read both this book and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Both gave me insight into how others live in a different part of the world.  I had not seen the movie before I read the book.  I had to seek it out and see it once I finished the book.  Many should read these books that are so well written.  Historical yet riveting.
Books_5,4,OR,would have like to no if they got lucky at the end I've got dogs and I love them I'm very sick person my dogs are by my side all the time so this was close to my heart
Books_5,5,OR,"Had zero interest in the subject matter going in but loved the book, nonetheless. A great story, well-told."
Books_5,1,OR,"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:

P1: Everything that exists has a cause

Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:

P2: The universe exists.
-------------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)

But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.

This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!

For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:

P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence.
P2: The universe began to exist.
-----------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).

Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.

One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.

That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them."
Books_5,5,OR,"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft."
Books_5,4,OR,Each one in the series just gets better.  A wonderful  escape from the doom and gloom headlines of every day life.  Ladybug Farm is a seven book series and I already know I'll be suffering separation anxiety when I'm done with them all.  Off to the next one:)
Books_5,4,OR,"This book was enjoyable and an entertaining read.  It was nice in that the book engaged me and took my mind off of anything other than the book while I was reading it.  I chose this book after seeing the cover for the latest Maisie Dobbs story and liking the picture wanting to know more.  I decided to start with the first book in the series after reading reviews by other readers and a few professionals.

I enjoyed the transition from the curreny mystery back into Maisie's background to help develop her character which added some mystery itself.  The shift back to the mystery at the end tied everthing together nicely.

I am encouraging my wife to read the book and share it with her book club.  I will likely read more of the Maisie Dobbs series."
Books_5,3,OR,I'm looking forward to future novels about the young detective. This wasn't so bad. I thought it was too technical especially when it refer to history about sports greats. I would like more mystery in his future novels and less history. But the ending was great.
Books_5,4,OR,I enjoy his books predictable for fun.  I know I will enjoy the read.
Books_5,4,OR,"This might be my favorite celebrity memoir audiobook to date, simply because Martin Short is so freaking entertaining. On second thought, that's not the full reason why I loved this one...

While the narration performance was expectedly funny and entertaining (Short does a ton of impressions, including some of his most infamous charactersEd Grimley, Jiminy Glickas well as of his many celebrity friends, and he sings!), there were also some unexpectedly poignant and heart-wrenching moments captured too. Short spoke candidly about pretty much everything, and I have concluded that the man has the memory of an elephant because he was able to recall events and moments in his life dating back to his childhood with such pinpoint specificity, it was truly astonishing.

These read-by-the-author comedian celebrity memoirs have become my favorite things to listen to on audio. Even with the ridiculous name-dropping and chronology and details of things I don't remember or never even saw, I love how they give you both a performance and a real look inside the heart and soul of these entertainers.

If you are a casual fan of Martin Short, who I now feel like I know well enough to call ""Marty,"" treat yourself to I MUST SAY on audio. You won't regret it.

RATING: A-/B+ (4 stars)"
Books_5,5,OR,"Enjoyed this book immensely.  Count Rostov certainly exhibited ""an essential faith that by the smallest of one's actions one can restore some sense of order to the world"".  Considering his circumstances he did just that although it took decades."
Books_5,5,OR,"Since the first book of this series was written, I have kept up with each new novel. I love the stories about Angel Island... after falling in love with the people of Cape Light! Great books. Easy reads. Thought-provoking. Looking forward to the next book!"
Books_5,5,OR,"A wonderful book that led to a long conversation with my child.  Beautifully written and illustrated, the story tells a simple tale attacking materialism and promoting charity, that is perfectly written so as to turn to your childen and say, ""what was that story about.""  In a consumeristic age, and a culture where the relatives dump endless supplies of plastic stuff on the kids, this book sends a good counter message about the meaning of life."
Books_5,5,OR,"A remarkable life story by a remarkable woman.
Sotomayor tells of her life experiences in down-to-earth terms. It is a warm and wonderful book."
Books_5,4,OR,"This was a really enjoyable book. It sucked me in from the very beginning. I cared about the characters right away and wanted to know what was happening to them. The heartache and sorrow the characters felt. I know there are men out there who are very controlling of their girlfriend and spouse and this book shows a little bit of how one can be manipulated and cut off from their family. It is a pretty quick read because you will not want to put it down. I recommend this book and really enjoyed reading it. When it was done I wanted to know more about the characters. All the women in the book are strong women but they don't see it, the reader does."
Books_5,5,OR,excellent reading  and story.  Could not put the book down.
Books_5,3,OR,"On the off chance that like me you've read Big Chief Elizabeth and Samurai William (or at least one of them), it may be worth me stating that in my opinion this is the least impressive of the three. In agreement with the review below, Nathaniel's 'story occupies only a small part of this book', and it remains a trifle unconvincing that his 'endeavours were pivotal in the course of history'.

That being said, there are all the usual details - from tragic biographies to prolonged and agonising torture - to keep you turning the pages, and it is certainly interesting to read once again about how horrible those Dutch were to the poor English (as can also be read about in Samurai William). Then, of course, Milton is great at weaving a yarn together, and it is always fascinating to read about the exploits of various larger-than-life adventures; particularly those exploits centred on parts other than the 'spiceries' themselves. The book is a light and enjoyable read, but it is most certainly worth a read. Milton's greatest contribution to history is, I feel, his abilities to take a reader's imagination so convincingly back to a time of pirates and uncharted adventure."
Books_5,5,OR,Was a. really great book.very exciting .I never lost interest.the book keeps you guessing. I've read the series twice now and have enjoyed the books
Books_5,5,OR,"I LOVE THIS TOO!
I couldn't put it down.. I just read every time I had an opportunity!!!"
Books_5,5,OR,"You needn't be an historian, geologist or even American to be captivated by this insightful and entertaining examination of those movers and shakers of American history (well-known and unknown) who helped to guide it...and the world...through extraordinary accomplishments."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is part of Alistair Horne's four remarkable books about the military history of France from 1870 to 1962.

This  volume chronicles the collapse of the French army and government in 1940. No matter how powerful your army, lack of political will ends in defeat."
Books_5,5,OR,This years favorite book. I really wanted to understand life in Kentucky and the exodus to the midwest and the problems in the area after coal left so many people without jobs. This is an important book for Democrats to understand why people voted for Trump and a way to have more compassion for those coming from Coal country. I don't want to give more away but this shows the situation in a compassionate loving way about family and their strong bonds.
Books_5,5,OR,"Majorie Kinnan Rawlings had a great deal of talent, and did a *lot* of research for this book that takes place in 1871-1872.  She also was blessed with the most brilliant of editors, Max Perkins, who was an editor for 20th century literary giants like Fitzgerald and Hemingway.

It was Perkins who kept Rawlings on track with her novel, reminding her that the novel should not be just written 'for a boy' but also 'about a boy'.  He was the one who pointed out to her that her writing genius lay in stringing together episodes rather than hatching out intricate plots.  In addition, it was Perkins who reminded Rawlings that the setting was full of tough times and tough people & she should avoid the theatricality and romanticism that sometimes crept into early drafts of the novel and really strive to emphasize, even increase the naturalism.

 Finally, Perkins remained dissatisfied with Rawlings' early title: The Fawn.  He suggested that she find a more symbolic title.  When she came up with titles like The Flutter-Mill or Juniper Island, he held her to her task, saying that there was not enough human suggestion.  When she sent him a list including the eventual title, Perkins was satisfied that this was the right one.

Shortly after that, Rawlings decided what she'd written was inferior & threw it out.  Perkins prodded her to get going again.  This book IS a classic, Rawlings WAS talented, unbelievably so, but neither would be as true if it were not for the dedicated brilliance of Max Perkins.  Read THE YEARLING & also the excellent biography of Perkins by A. Scott Berg."
Books_5,5,OR,"wow, what we didn't know was going on during the cold war! Very good to finally know ""some"" of the history, amazing  ..."
Books_5,5,OR,"I didn't want to stop reading this to do anything else. It was that good. Just loved the author's voice and the characters - including the animals. The plot kept me guessing until the end. I usually can tell who the murderer was, but not with this one. And when I found out, it felt ""right.""

I used to love reading cozies, but then they began to feel so familiar, as if I'd read them before. Every once in a while, I'll still give a book that sounds interesting a try. It was wonderful to read this and feel that love again."
Books_5,5,OR,"Mr. Putter loves giving presents at Christmas time but although he starts planning in July it always takes him until December to decide what to give his neighbor and friend, Mrs. Teaberry. He knows that she likes salt shakers that walk, dresses for her teapots etc. What he can't believe is that she actually likes fruitcake! SO he decides that this Christmas she needs a ""light and airy cake"". Only one problem! Mr. Putter doesn't know how to bake a cake nor does he have any of the equipment.

Mr. Putter and Tabby, his cat, go to visit Mary Sue, the owner of the Sweet Shop. Mary Sue gladly helps him purchase all that he needs and so on Christmas Eve we see Mr. Putter baking the cake. How many times will it take him before he succeeds? What will Mrs. Teabody think of his gift? What happens on Christmas Day?

This is a delightful, well-written and beautifully illustrated book which is one of our young son's favorites. Just adorable! Highly recommended!"
Books_5,2,OR,"To complicated, need a medical degree to figure this out.  The other books are much better.  It is in no way and easy read."
Books_5,1,OR,This book was engaging until the last chapter. It was as if the author wrote the required number of pages and then just quit.  I would not waste my time on this book.
Books_5,2,OR,"I work as a senior DNA researcher. This book has an interesting topic, but is not up to date with current knowledge. E.g. in the nienties, people believed chromosomal ends - telomeres - were biological clocks. People believed that telomere length could be used to predict lifespan. Telomeres are huge parts of the junk DNA. The telomere theory was largely abandoned 5-6 years ago. If you know a fair bit about DNA, then this book is not for you. I know the DNA field is rapidly expanding, but somehow I anticipated a more modern book"
Books_5,5,OR,"Fast paced, keeps you riveted. One of my favorite by this author. Would recommend to anyone who likes suspense novels."
Books_5,5,OR,"I will never say that I am too tired, or that I cannot do or take it anymore. My new hero is Regina Calcaterra, a proud Long Islander, who rises to the top despite every misgiving that could be thrown at a child. Despite what the authorities told hershe survivedfinished high school, went to college while working several jobs, and became a lawyer.
Im standing and clapping right now.
Etched in Sand is an eye-opening account of Regina and her four siblingsall with different fatherslife struggles through the foster care and child protective system. This isn't TV where everything is honky-dory. This story brings to lighta foster care system that is broken and full of holes. This is real life and how the lowest form of human beings abuses the system.
Regina lived in the shadows of a heinous, abusive, (add any horrible word you can think of here), and neglectful mother while fending for them self. Dumpster diving for food and clothes; sleeping five across the back seat of a car, or in the trunk when they could. Despite living through the most horrible conditions, anyone could put to wordsRegina, with some help from her two older siblings manages to raise and keep her family together.
When Reginas mother is not out on her month-on-end drinking and sex bingesshe is beating and humiliating Regina to the brink of death. Why you ask? Because the dirt bag of a man who fathered Reginano names here, you have to read it for yourselfleft before Regina was even born. Regina eventually proves who her father was, but she had to live with her mothers wrath every day since he left.
Yes, Regina is my new hero and the foster care and child protective services system will be a better place because of her.
Im not ready to switch political parties just yet, but oh hell, why notRegina Calcaterra for President."
Books_5,5,OR,"I totally enjoyed this touching story.  The lives of these strong resilient women  should never be forgotten!  A sad story, but the strength of family is shown as being uppermost in their lives, and I believe that is what helped them endure."
Books_5,3,OR,"I have learned a little bit with this book, but she spends far too much time justifying science rather than elucidating it. It comes off quite defensive, and a bit annoying While I am interested in the LHC and have learned a lot about it, it is not why I wanted to buy the book. I am struggling to finish it. While it is well read, I give it a 'meh'."
Books_5,5,OR,All six books were great. If you can read them in order.
Books_5,5,OR,"I loved Steelheart. LOVED it.
Why do all the superhero stories and comics portray those with these superpowers as ""good"" and moral?"" Brandon Sanderson takes this supposition and turns it on its head by giving the super-powered in Steelheart's universe one side to be on -- the bad side. They are the villains and those without powers have either accepted it and given up or are doing their best to fight back. I loved the story and look forward to what Sanderson comes up with next."
Books_5,5,OR,"My Cowboy Valentine - Jane Porter & Tanya Michaels

Be Mine, Cowboy by Jane Porter
Cade is a recovering alcoholic who is back in Rachel's life after walking out on her five years ago when she attempted to help him with his problems. In the five years since her heart was broken, Rachel has been struggling to raise her autistic son, doing everything she can to protect him from people who don't understand him. Now that Cade is back she is struggling with feelings that never went away and has to decide whether or not she can trust him not only with her but also with her son.

Be Mine, Cowboy is a sweet, emotional read. Rachel's love for her son is evident in everything she does and you really feel for her and the issues that can come with raising a special needs child. Cade knows that he hurt Rachel when he left and is doing what he can to make amends and win Rachel back. I really enjoyed their story and Jane did a great job. My only wish is that it was a longer story.

Hill Country Cupid by Tanya Michaels
Tess is known for doing what she can in helping out her friends in giving them a push towards something that they want. She's known Nick for several years and decides that he needs help in courting the woman he's lusted after since high school. While helping Nick become more comfortable in flirting with the opposite sex, Tess realizes that she has feelings for Nick but doesn't want to be anyone's second best.

Hill Country Cupid is a nice, fun Valentine's read. I loved Nick and Tess together and seeing them overcome the obstacles keeping them apart. I really enjoyed Nick's determination to show Tess that she is his first choice above anyone else and that they belonged together."
Books_5,5,OR,"I sampled the book, then bought it. I found Scott Adams insights and experience match what I've seen work.

I marked it up for my youngest son, just starting out as an adult. Then I bought two more copies - one for oldest son, and another to replace mine. Adams' style is accessible and clear.

A few key takeaways:

- Use systems, not goals
- Try not to sell your time due to limited upside; your time is finite and limited
- Try to find a product that is infinitely scalable, that you can sell again and again (Intellectual Property might be one way)
- Piecing together complementary skills can make you _very_ much more effective
- Look to maximize your personal energy - the foundation of all else

==

The above are all key enablers for someone starting off. Scott Adams lays out a system to effectively experiment your way to personal success.

I strongly recommend this book to new graduates and anyone trying to be more effective on their own terms."
Books_5,5,OR,"If you are thinking about buying this book think no more. For those of you who need a basic idea of what its about let me sum it up. Its about a boy who is a genius who believes in what most people would think inpossible and discovers it is not only true  but far more advanced. Fairies. But these aren't you sparkling flower fairies. These are gun weilding, electric winged, magic world police. Sworn to keep their world secret safe from all human kind. Nor is this boy just a genius, but also is one the worlds most wanted crimnals, to humans and fairies alike. And he just cracked the code. With mystery everywhere in the story( and along the pages for those who know and have cracked it) It is deffently an awsome read. Don't think anymore."
Books_5,5,OR,I enjoyed this book it was a softer version of the other books in this series but was so good one of my favorites it had the action but most of all you felt the love the family had for each other in this book.
Books_5,5,OR,"I liked the story.  I thought it was well written, even though I was confused in the beginning about who was talking in each chapter.  It gets clearer as you get to know the characters.  I liked the twists, the characters, the beginning and the end.  Very good read."
Books_5,2,OR,I can see how other people like this book but for me it was just too much on the dark side and several things about it bothered me.
Books_5,5,OR,"AUDIO book: Engrossing true story. Especially for us living in OKC. The narrator, deserves special recognition. I can't decide if she was overacting; hated the mostly whisprey dialoge, or if she really had a great story-teller voice."
Books_5,5,OR,"I normally don't go for straight non-fiction memoirs, but this is an unusual book in its structure and tone. Stasiland has all the virtues of a pacey novel combined with providing deep insights on the impact of the DDR's horrible regime on painfully ordinary people.

The author manages to work in personal travalogue and investigative journalism without any elements jarring or feeling out of place. It's very, very good. Anyone with an interest in the end of the cold war era must read it. Actually, anyone should read it - even if you'd never heard of the DDR it's riveting stuff."
Books_5,5,OR,Excellent book. Highly recommended. Other readers had a problem with the layout of the book but I still found the though I knew that he would live the action in the story kept me engaged and still offered plenty of surprises.
Books_5,3,OR,"Cary Grant was gorgeous, suave, a very good actor, and at times could be a controlling and confused man. Dyan Cannon writes about Mr. Grant with openness, and yes, is is HER autobiography as well as his biography in a sense. Covering the years from her start in Hollywood to just about the current day, Ms. Cannon does not hold back in her analysis of what made Mr. Grant tick. Having read several books by other authors, and having a film history background, there was little in the book that made me doubt Ms. Cannon's veracity. Cary Grant was open about his LSD experimentation and was constantly searching for depth and meaning in his personal life and retired at probably just the perfect moment; before his looks were regarded as passes to 1960s filmgoers and just as he himself was growing bored with his work.

The latter part of the book focuses on the repercussions of her marriage and life with Cary Grant and much was new and enlightening. (I do not spoil plots or details). A loving mother, continuing to act and work in films, Dyan Cannon has written a very good addition to the Hollywood biography canon."
Books_5,3,OR,"I've never read a Dean Koontz I didn't finish, and that's saying a lot for the author.  I haven't read any further into the series, though I probably will.  I wouldn't call it page-turning.  If you haven't read Koontz before don't start with this.  If you have and you're like me - you just want something you know you'll read - this might be for you."
Books_5,5,OR,"It is not often that you find a book that looks at the relationships with fathers and daughters. The special capacity of this book is its ability to develop this relationship realistically, and to truly look at life in the black community. The fact that there are a lot of hard-working, loving fathers in that community needs to be told often and in a manner that is fun and easy to read. This book accomplishes this without being preachey - just real."
Books_5,5,OR,"An intense tale of three rebelious young girls indulging in alcohol, drugs, and sex and inexorably racing to a shared treaumatic event which will alter each of their life odysseys beyond redemption. The narrative scheme, flickering back and forth from the world of teenagers to the outcomes 15 years later, is skillfully employed to produce waves of suspenseful inevitability and soaring emotional intensity, and the characters are so vivid that the reader feels almost impelled to somehow prevent the impending doom of each woman. The effects of drug and alcohol abuse are as graphically described as the sex. Brilliant writing in every respect."
Books_5,5,OR,A brutally honest depiction of the holocaust. Beautifully written and emotionally riveting. I purchased the book after visiting the holocaust museum in Washington DC. A survivor who spoke to my students told them this was the most accurate depiction of the holocaust.
Books_5,5,OR,"As a reader of self-help books, I rarely come across one that has true everyday application.  Once having read this and using the techniques daily, my mood has changed dramatically to the better.

He writes in a simple and clear manner that is understandable, comprehensive and compelling.

If you have depression or anxiety, you can immediately use the techniques and find relief.

Highly recommended."
Books_5,5,OR,One of the most important American plays has never looked so good in print. This is an immaculate copy of the play script. It is easy to read and the words are fairly good sized compared to the amount of text present.
Books_5,2,OR,"This tale is very disappointing. Although Le Carr is much touted as an insider to the international intelligence community, his stories can be written by any author that reads the newspapers. Ed Spievack, author of ""Memoirs of an Unfinished Generation."
Books_5,4,OR,"I rarely read ""Who Dun Its"" anymore, but this one was an exception that I read on the recommendation of my son and daughter. I liked Lisbeth, the main character. She was very unique. I could not figure out who the murder was until the end which to me makes a good mystery. I can usually guess. I have already recommended this book to others. I saw the movie first which is the order in which I should proceed."
Books_5,5,OR,"I didn't realize that it was a CD when I bought it, but I had heard such good reviews from my pen pal I just had to get it to check it out.
Tao of Pooh was a great read, I'm still trying to understand this on another level. Over all though, I don't regret buying it."
Books_5,5,OR,"Short, concise, to the point -- PERFECT. I've been a Basecamp user for a long time (the author is the creator of Basecamp), so buying the book was a win, especially when I saw it on Mark Cuban's suggested reading list. If you have a small business or are starting one, don't do ANYTHING until you read this book."
Books_5,5,OR,"I saw this movie when I was a kid, but I never knew it was a book until I found it on Amazon. I just finished reading it to my 4 year old, and we both really enjoyed it. It is well written and exciting, but not too scary. I highly recommend it. It's a short book for adults, but a great length for children."
Books_5,4,OR,Very entertaining but it seemed like he was trying to get a movie deal or something.  Not as intellectual or intertwined as other books of his.
Books_5,5,OR,What a great book!  I preordered this book and read it as soon as I received it.  I'm glad I did.  It was a wild ride with so many changes.  I can't help but be caught up by the plot and action in the story.  I also have to say the author does an amazing job with her character development and world building.  I've been so immersed it's going to be challenging to wait for the next installation in this series.  All and all this was an amazing read and I definitely recommend this book and this series.
Books_5,3,OR,"some what complicated and very difficult to understand the plot at times, at least the ending was ok. never did understand what really happened to Greys young girl sidekick."
Books_5,5,OR,Sue Grafton knocked it out of the park with X!!!!!  I've read everyone of her books and this is Sue at her best.  Loved it.
Books_5,5,OR,"I am a young teen who recently read this book and I personal believe that  this book is pretty innocent compared to the ""The Big Nate"" series. It Has intelligent humor unlike the big Nate series too. there is not a lot of disrespectfulness of other people in this book and it dosen't have bad messages unlike big Nate. The reason I am comparing it to big Nate series is because I am aware that both books are very popular and funny, but I have read big Nate, and i would agree that it has a very bad message, with unintelligent humor, and many inappropriate scenes. I would prefer children reading diary of a wimpy kid more so then the school drop-out who likes to skip school big Nate. In diary of a wimpy kid the main character is not a school drop-out But does talk a little bit about girls, but not a lot. Diary of a wimpy kid deals with some problems that people may face in real life in the dramatic middle school, like problems with friends, bullying, and looking ""cool"",  but the author took these problems and added some funny spice to them to make it a Funny novel that children can laugh at and say, ""I know exactly how he feels, but how did he deal with it? I think i am going to read on to find out."" this book is a great and funny series that is overall innocent and deserves only the best. It makes children want to read the addicting book. It takes problems people face everyday and turns them into a laughable story. I would suggest this book to all ages."
Books_5,5,OR,"I think my granddaughter will enjoy this!  Arrived in excellent shape, just as promised."
Books_5,5,OR,This was a birthday present for my great neice. This is the theme that she's crazy about.
Books_5,4,OR,"I bought this book on a recommendation and though I gave up a few days of my life over it (and the next 2 in the series), I'm glad I did! The first two chapters were a bit slow-going, and I actually came back to the book about a month after I initially started it. However, once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The author constructs a wonderful world to set her story in and develops strong, interesting characters over the three books. In the first book, A Great and Terrible Beauty, she outlines her initial plot about a girl raised in colonial India but forced to move to a boarding school in late 19th century England after her mother is murdered. The intrigue, romance, fantastical elements, and believable scenery of England during that era make it an engaging tale. It is a great story, but also very well written. By the end of the book, I was carrying my Kindle everywhere and already anticipating buying the next installment in the series!"
Books_5,3,OR,"I chose this book as we've recently traveled throughout the west. Though I found the storyline interesting, the story itself seemed slow moving. I was not drawn to return to the story and so the reading dragged out. I just don't feel I ever connected with the writer's voice. I am pleased to know that many of the characters were based on actual people of the era."
Books_5,5,OR,"I have seen the first season. Now reading the first novel. It is reeling me in more and more. The descriptive nature of the writing is entrancing. The line from ""The Gathering"" about the bagpipers relating that the trilling of the chanters above the drones ""made the blood itch"" made me stop  and read again and again. It is the finest description I have read. I feel my skin shivering at the thought."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is the best guide for beginner writers on the market. Why? It's fun to read and it is short. I misplaced my copy from s college course (lent it to the wrong person) and my husband purchased a copy for me for our anniversary several years later. I cried (because I was so happy). If that isn't a good sign, I don't know what is. Who needs jewelry when you know how to write with style!"
Books_5,5,OR,Kristin Cashore comes up with a wonderfully new concept in the fantasy world and I cannot wait to read her other books.  Not boring moment in the book!
Books_5,5,OR,"His writing has always kept me reading , not wanting to put the book down or miss something . Clever , informative and always a pleasure to read !"
Books_5,5,OR,"Not knowing much, if anything about N. Korea I thought now would be a good time to learn something about it.  This was an excellent book to start with.  Very interesting!!  A school for the creme' de la' creme' of N. Korea.  The MIT of the country and these 'boys' know nothing of the Internet and the world outside their severely controlled world of N. Korea.
  The affection of their American teacher for them and vice versa is obvious and helps us to understand why she doesn't endanger them by screaming out, ""This isn't how the world is!  You're missing out on a lifetime of adventure!""
  She observes learns and teaches us.  Perhaps someday that will be enough to start world wide awareness and help for these poor, isolated, and completely controlled citizens."
Books_5,5,OR,It is a beautiful Bible. It's lightweight and easy to carry. I love the illustrations and the wide margins for journaling and note taking. I highly recommend this Bible.
Books_5,4,OR,"When it happened, I remember a blip in the news about this story. This book filled in details--I learned about a whole world of cartography.  Sometimes slow reading, but I learned about maps, crimes, collectors, library security."
Books_5,4,OR,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a book for dreamers, lovers and the mommas boy in all of us. I lived at home until I was a vine-ripened 27, so believe me I can relate to James Thurbers Mitty. And Ive always been a fond of a good daydream. Lets see what comes to me now:

Im a powerful land baron with an eye patch. Nay, a feudal samurai lord. No, Im an oil tycoon. Fabulously rich, silver-haired, steely-eyed and whats this? Im in turbulent fight with my lover, no my sister, no my lover and her vengeful son. He has gun. So do I! This tension is terrifying. Daydream continued in the next paragraph.

Where was I? Ah yes, the daydream. Now, Im a young man. A prospector trying to hit it rich. Do I? Yes! This is my daydream, of course Ill hit it rich. Black gold. The farm is saved. I am more lost in this daydream than any I have ever had. Its spellbinding. Its tear-jerking. Spine-tingling. There are plots upon plots upon plots. It twists, it turns. Its a veritable roller coaster ride of goddamn emotion. This is by far the most powerful daydream Ive ever experienced. It feels like an eternity, yet no time has passed. I am exhausted.

And now, I have a confession to make. That was no daydream. That was me experiencing in both words and pharmaceutical hallucinations, the broad plot of my dramatic novel The Spoils of Babylon, set to air on IFC, this very January the 9th, 2014. Adapted, directed, casted and colored in full Breath-Take-o-Scope by yours truly. I do apologize for my surreptitious diatribe, but I must admit, I can scarcely contain my excitement. After more than 40 years and literally thousands of edits (two editors died), the hour is upon us. And it shall be no mere daydream.

Oh, and read The Secret Life of Walter Mitty sometime, its a delight.

Finest regards,

Eric Jonrosh, author, The Soils of Babylon, airing on IFC, January 9th, 2014"
Books_5,5,OR,"I read this book at least ten years ago and I loved it then and still enjoyed reading it again this week. Years ago, I remember thinking to myself, why have they not turned this three part series into the next movie trilogy. You already have an awesome storyline in a still mega-popular franchise. What is Hollywood waiting for?  I'd pay to see it, for sure."
Books_5,5,OR,Bought this book as a gift for my wife!  Needless to say she loved it!
Books_5,3,OR,"Nothing too fabulous here.  Plus, we got the paperback through Scholastic and it cost only a couple dollars."
Books_5,5,OR,"I read this the first time so many years ago, that I do have to admit I had forgotten so much about the many side stories and characters. Why that should take away from a novel for some readers is beyond me, but everyone has their favorites. I would only say, so many stories in books and movies these days are so pat. I always tease my wife for rushing through her novels, and she's always teasing me for insisting on reading every. single. word, and doing so at a pace I think the author may appreciate. If a book's an easy read, I'll motor through it in a couple hours, but a more dense novel filled with beautiful writing, well, I'll happily go at a tortoise's pace. I bring this up to say, this novel stuck with me for so many years for a reason. Why let yourself get frustrated if the author chooses to take his time? I read this as a child and over the years have loved apocalyptic stories. Some of the more recent blockbuster movies in the genre have greatly disappointed. Lucifer's Hammer was brilliant in that it showed how so many outstanding plans, crafted by sharp people, dedicated to detail, can all fall to, well, you'll see. The guy made homemade beef jerky, stocked his jeep with all the necessary gear, and backup gear of the most important stuff, and was absolutely prepared for the coming disaster."
Books_5,5,OR,"I love this very different take on a Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory idea.  I loved the constantly changing character perspective, I loved the story, and I loved the character growth."
Books_5,5,OR,"I buy these books for my husband each year.  He is not an enthusiastic reader of novels, but he loves trivia, so he is thrilled with this book.  I highly recommend it for the person on your list who is hard to shop for... who can resist learning a bit of trivia?"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Bought this for my ""personal item"" instead of a laptop backpack for an upcoming European trip.  Have used it already to transport laptop and ipad.  Looking forward to using it.  Much more comfortable to carry than backpack.  Can wear it cross-body.  Distinctive color; great Pacsafe safety features.  So- since I've used it I can tell I'm going to love it, but I don't know exactly how great it will meet my needs until after I make the trip.  I think it's going to be great as my ""personal item"" on the plane.  I got the CS200 to carry around like a purse while there.  This would be way too huge to carry on daily walkabouts."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Amazing earrings especially for the price.  They are dainty but the color of the stones is good, the clasp is good.  I can't even believe they were an add on item!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I have to start woth I LOVE this dress. I was so scared when ordering this. Afraid it would be another onlinw order sizing fail or something but the second I opened it it all went away!  This dress is made very well. Does not look cheap one bit. The dress itself looked exactly like the picture and fit perfect. I loved the dress the second I put it on. I could go on forever. Im extremely happy with this purchase. I would definitely recomend this dress to anyone.
-I purchased this product at a discount/promotional Rate in exchange for my honest review."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"These are great!  Stitching was without an issue - and does what I needed it to do - keep my head from burning on long summer runs.

As an added bonus - I've found if I take my water bottle and pour it on my head - these stay wet for quite a while as well."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"my 7 year old got a ton of use in the snow and mud. never leaked, no cold feet."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"It's definitely a full cape, which is awesome!  It's nice quality and is perfect for my costume!  The purple lining is a little more plum than what the picture shows, but that's not a problem to me."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"I've purchased many washes of this size and cut, and I find that every pair fits me a little bit differently. This particular wash (""cast shadows"") is much looser than other washes I own, and they stretch out more throughout the day. (These jeans in ""soft black"" are my favorites."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Large Canvas Duffel

Purchased to store my 7.5' full Christmas tree with lights.  The bag worked well; handles are sturdy and there are enough of them sewn around the bag they are actually useful.  The bag is now hanging by one of those handles with no issues of tearing, ripping, or shredding.

Tree was 3 pieces, I wrapped the tree sections with that stretchy cellophane packing wrap - best way I can imagine to control the needle fluff. That left me a 4' x 24"" base, a 4' by 18"" mid section, and a 2' x 12"" top.  Base went in large end first, mid section skinny end first, and that left a lot of room for the top at the opposite end of the bag; also dropped a few more Christmas display items in for good measure.

The result was heavy; but lifting the bag didn't result in any tears or punctures (honestly, I was expecting one of the pole ends to push through at some point).  Once I had the bag where I wanted it, I tied a rope to one of the end handles, and hoisted the bag off the floor.  Now the tree is out of the way, and stored in a good spot where it won't get banged around.

The duffel bag is probably too big for most any other use I can imagine; but was perfect for storing my $400 tree.  Though I may buy another to store ALL of my camping gear in one spot and allow me to lift it off the floor, too. Hmmm...  glad I wrote this review :)"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,Not as comfortable as I thought. Back digs into heal. Hoping they break in.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.  The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of times converting to Russian and it works pretty well.

All in all I think this is kind of a niche product.  The size limits the market even more, as it's huge."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I got this ring as a pinky ring. It fit perfect and looks just the way they said. It is of high quality and will definitely be buying more from here.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"For me this was exactly the size purse I was looking for.  The outside feels really nice and there are tons of compartments. For the price,  this was better than I expected.

You do  get what you pay for though.  The inside feels and looks very cheap and I don't love the feel of the strap.  I took no points off for these issues because they are minor and if I expected a higher quality I should pay more.  This purse was exactly as described and perfect for me.  I would definitely recommend it and when it wears out I will probably buy another."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I normally wear a 36D, and depending on the bra I'm wearing I sometimes get a little bulge in the cleavage area. But if I go up to DD, the cups are too big.

These fit perfectly! They give me a nice natural shape, no bulge anywhere and super comfortable. I love them.

I have 2 of these, and I got them at Walmart for about $12 apiece. At the time I am writing this review, they are available on Walmart's website."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Only had them a week or so, but so far so good.  They fit well, and with me being  cabinet maker, customers love the wooden arms."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Love it! .......... sooooo comfortable you can't go wrong with one of these ..... washed up great as well.  I used warm wash and med dry.  Nice length, even for me  (I am 5'10"")."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"As an individual who has dealt with a small cup size all my life, I am used to disappointment when purchasing bras. Even more so now that I have gained weight, and can't even find my size in a store. So, despite the glowing reviews of this bra, I was prepared for yet another bra with puckered, too-large cups, and an uncomfortable band. Surprise! It fits and is extremely comfortable. Somehow, even though the sizing for 2X seems to indicate a C cup, (or above) the bra manages to both to fit and flatter my B-  sizing. And though the band in front does tend to wrinkle/fold over a little, I don't care. A bra that flatters and is comfortable is rare, and I am purchasing more."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I would have given this 5 stars but I have only been carrying it a while and already the straps are coming off. The tiny straps that hold on the big straps are only stapled on, not sewn! Did I buy a knock off? I cannot believe Michael Kors would use staples.  The style and size are fantastic. I will take it to the shoe repairs and have him sew it back together."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"It's a really lovely ring! i love it, i purchased it with a pendant and earrings, but most of all i liked this one."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"These are super cute, very comfortable and warm. I don't like to wear them barefoot as I can feel the seams, but with a pair of socks they are just right. Fun slippers, well crafted. I've gotten compliments from friends and family."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I love the FRYE boot, it is more than what I expected."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Just right!  The color is perfect and the fit is great.  I really like it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"What can I say, they hold my pants up.  The clips are sturdy and they are easily adjustable.  Good alternative to a belt."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"This is my 4th purchase, this exercise bra is supportive, it fits well, it's comfortable and it doesn't loose it's shape.  I highly recommend it.  I've tried sports bras that have cost twice as much and have been utterly disappointing.  If you're broad shouldered or endowed this is the sports bra for you."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,love the shoe and fits well.  I have narrow feet so there is a bit of gap but not noticeable.  Only problem is they squeak when I walk.  Wonder about WD-40 on the sisal -:)
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"These are awesome tights but the camel toe they give...
I got a medium, fit very nicely. High waisted and a little too stretchy on the ankle. For size reference I'm 5'6, roughly 150lbs, and about a 28 in waist.

Update: I worked out for them for the first time, super comfy but crap they are thin. Squat proof but your panties line is extremely obvious. I also like the back of the calf panel of slightly preferated material."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,They fit snug but that is part of why they do such a great job preventing hotspots and blisters-- no more sliding around! I love them for the gym and mowing the lawn. I also appreciate that they are made in America.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I normally take a half size bigger in sneakers to leave room for toes when I run.
However, so far so good even though I took my exact size. Fits snuggle-ly too. Quite comfy. After my last pair of Asics were used until they couldn't run another mile, I stuck to the brand and I'm glad I did."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Great quality but I thought it would be a little bigger , overall it's a great wallet"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Very good looking, well-made shoe. My grandson loves his Chucks, as he calls them. He wears them to work, but he does add gel arch support soles as he's on his feet a lot."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Planning to travel to Japan meant a 14-hour flight  in coach!  That made it imperative that both my husband and I purchase and wear compression socks.  After I researched various brands and styles, Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large were better suited to my husbands picky preferences than other options.  Stockwell uses a higher percentage of natural fibers than many other brands of socks.  As a result, they wicked moisture better and did not make his feet to sweat more profusely.  They were firmer (20  30 mm Hg) than the majority of compression socks (10  20 mmHG).  The socks graduated compression and well-fitted feet made Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large the socks for him.

Sizing is always a challenge when it comes to purchasing any clothing online.  My husband wears an 11 to 11  Medium in shoes.  The Large/X-Large size fits him well and is comfortable.  At its maximum point, his calf is about 16 in circumference.  The socks extend to the crease in the back of his knees  about 17"" from the floor; this circumference of area also measures about 16.  His foot is 11 long and the circumference around the arch is about 9 .

Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large are constructed with care.  Unlike my socks that had a more prominent knot on one side of the toe area, my husbands socks had smooth toe seams.  The top of the sock has a rolled, zigzag-stitched hem that approximately 3/8 wide.  It has not rolled during wearing.

Although these socks can be machine washed and dried, I prefer to hand wash and dry them flat.  I believe this will increase their useful life.  Amazons price for these socks, combined with PRIME shipping and free returns, makes them a much better value than the same item purchased from one of the online travel clothing retailers."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I ordered four bathrobes to choose from. So far, I have received two, including the Natori Divine Robe in Midnight Blue. It is beautiful! It's very well made, soft as could be and warm without being suffocating like some heavier robes. The length is perfect. I love the color; it's much prettier in person. My husband loves the look of it on me. I am very happy with this robe! The sleeves were rolled up and tacked in place but I removed the tacking. I like my sleeves long on these types of robes."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"This was my first purchase of anything in the ATACS FG pattern and I must say I am very happy with the pattern.

The boonie looks well made out of very good quality made materiel, There are some slight assembly/sewing discrepancies if you look for them but nothing that would affect performance or concealment.

The outer ""utility"" band (the band you stick extra foliage) is made from shiny OD green nylon webbing, which detracts somewhat from the very flat, subdued pattern of the rest of the hat. I wish they could have used flat tan cotton webbing on it, or just doubled over some of the ripstop material that the rest of the hat is made from. It kind of sticks out on it in my own opinion. Not a big issue though, and the only thing I would change about it.

NOTE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL: This hat does NOT meet NIR Specs (Near Infrared Signature Management Technology)

Overall this is a very good buy for the money and I am well pleased with the purchase.

As far as sizing goes I have an old GI tan boonie made by propper that I've worn for years now and has been washed multiple times. It is a size a 7.25 (or 7 1/4) and right now it fits my head like a rubber band, even with only small amount of hair on my head. I considered also getting this boonie in 7.25 as well but chose 7.5 instead. I'm glad I did, 7.5 fits loose on my head but still tight enough to be comfortable. After a couple trips through the washer it will still be comfortable. Some good advice that propper put on the label is:

INITIAL LOOSE FIT REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED COMFORT!

So it's OK if you have a loose fit with it. It will shrink over time. Very happy all around with this purchase."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Got for a buddies wedding. Yet to use it but seems to be good for the price.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Seem pretty good, but I haven't really worn them for a couple hours at a time. I had return my 1st pair and get a bigger size & these were a little tight, but after a few wears they are about perfect."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,Very cute but just too small even though my other small exofficio shirts fit.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,"I also ordered 2E.  Way too narrow--cramped my feet right away.  Had to take them off and return.  Was VERY disappointed.  I have a pair of 2E mesh asics that are VERY comfortable.  Really wanted the non-mesh to work, but no dice."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to.
This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out.
Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that.
The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure!
The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice.
The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around.
The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow.
It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too.
It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear.
Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf.
I was fortunate enough to receive this scarf at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Great comfortable sandals for all day wear. But beware they are narrow.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,My husband is very picky about wallets. This one he loves!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,These are well made and the fabric stands up to a lot of wear and tear.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"You can wear the hood by itself, wear it with the hood, or wear just the jacket without the hood.  How is that for 3-in-1 systems?

Reminiscent of what Lands End sells as a ""Squall Jacket"", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.

Water and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.

Polyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.

I can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.

If it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.

Better garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.

I guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.

Garment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.

I've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.

And to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I purchased this belt because the XL was too small. Well, of course this belt is too big. I will be adding another hole to make it fit me. I wish there were a size in between the two, otherwise it's a good purchase."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,Product is smaller than expected.  This item was purchased twice (one for me and one for another).  Both had to be exchanged and seller requires purchaser to pay for return shipping on exchanges which cost over $10.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I love this watch. I use the quick timer for watching the garden water and cooking. I set the alarm to remind me of places I have to be. It tells the correct time. I lasts and lasts. I had the battery replaced after a long time.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"This wedding ring set arrived very quickly.  It really is a very nice set at a very reasonable cost.  It arrived in a very beautiful black velvet ring box.  I would not plan to wear this as an everyday ring set, since it is not a full white gold, just white gold plated, I would not expect it to hold up as well.  I like to wear different rings for different occasions, especially when traveling, so I don't have to worry about losing my actual ring set or having it stolen.

This set is very dainty looking and quite nice.  I ordered a size 7, which is what my original set is, and it fits perfectly. It's very comfortable to wear.  I take it off to wash my hands and I wouldn't sleep in it, so I have not seen any discoloration on the metal or on my hands.  For the price that this is offered at, I would definitely recommend it for someone to purchase as an extra set to wear on occasion.

Like most online shoppers, I read through reviews posted by others to determine whether I want to try out a product. I always do what I can to help by describing my purchases honestly. If I have been helpful please check yes, that it was helpful to you and I will do the same for all of the helpful reviews I find! Thank you for reading."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I own a lot of Chuvora jewelry and have never been disappointed. This ring is substantial but not heavy. Shiny. The size 9 was a perfect fit for my index finger. I really like jewelry from Chuvora.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I followed the advice of the other reviewers and ordered my Georgia Boot Romeos a half-size larger than usual, and they fit perfectly.  They were extremely comfortable right out of the box, and i have been happy with them ever since.  Highly recommend."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"The pants are well made, we like the cotton and wool fabric and the color"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"Cute, but they are only going to be comfortable on someone with a narrow foot."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Beautiful vibrant skirt, but snug at the waist. Size up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,Fits comfortably. Not too loose and not too tight. I like my clothes just a little looser and this fit the bill
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Typical pants I use, left leg is twisted to the inside. Stitching is off somehow? Wearing them anyway"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"This is a very nice looking shoe if it fits correctly.  I have a normal sized ankle and calf.  The top strap is wide but flattering and also a tinge on the shorter side.  I am wearing on the last hole so that it is not tight and uncomfortable.  I will most likely go down a notch once a little stretched to my foot.  The heel is the biggest consideration.  While I can wear them the whole day they are not totally comfortable the whole whole day.  The ball of my foot does feel some pressure as there is not a lot of padding or cushion. The heel is on the higher side of a wedge but again looks very attractive.  The material of the shoe is a suede like fabric and flexible, not stiff.  The only other issue I had was some rubbing of my baby toe which is not a defect of the shoe.  I think once warn a few more times and broken in they will be pretty good.  I have a wide foot so tend to buy a 1/2 size up for comfort.  They fit as expected for an average to wide foot. I would buy them again in another color and plan to when the price is right!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Love the color, perfect for the summer but as always the round toe shoe is a little tight by the toes as always and will have to be worn a few times to break in."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Being a fan of sterling silver I'm  not too hard to please. That being said I have found jewelry here on Amazon can be hit or miss. These earrings are very lightweight and have decent shine to them. The braided design makes them good for everyday casual wear and the locking clasp feels secure so I don't worry about losing them. Overall a solid 4 stars, only deducting one because I feel like there are just slightly overpriced."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,So cozy! My daughter brought this to college to go back and forth to the dorm shower. It is generously sized and she appreciates that for modesty.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,Barely makes any light and it stopped working after about a half hour of use.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I love these boots! Must agree with many other reviews in that they are slightly narrow through the forefoot, however I went up a half size for comfort. I wore them 1 full day and they stretched amazingly. The leather is of excellent quality on these babies. Im not one for stretching a shoe or boot but these were fine to Stretch no biggie or discomfort for me anyway. I am a believer in Frye so yeah these were right up my alley! Try the boot if you like the look. They fit nicely around my calf. Im not necessarily skinny either. I have thick calves and Im a curvy girl so not too tight as they actually were perfect for me. Im 143 lbs and 56 I wear an 8 in shoes but went up to an 8.5 for reference. I absolutely love these boots and as I wear them they get more broken in and they just look even more amazing."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"These Lowas replaced a pair of Lowa hiking boots I had and loved for almost 15 years. The fit is perfect for my feet,roomy in the front,as hiking boots should be,without being too big. The prune color is just beautiful. Also I am able to wear my orthotics in them comfortably. I look forward to years of happy hiking feet."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,This was purchased as a gift for my dad.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Happy that these were not the new ""stretch"" 505's. Good ole 505 fit."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Wow, it really is thin and low profile. The money strap works great and the wallet holds everything. Prefect for a front pocket! I highly recommend. The price is amazing for the quality you get."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Nice looking and great value, I cannot comment about quality because I just received the belt. I would recommend with no hesitation."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"My friend hasn't worn this one yet, so I can't give it an honest review, but he loved the white one. I will assumed he loves this one as well!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"the robe, not necessarily the man who will be wearing it  ;o}

But really, I fell in love with this robe when I opened the box. It is super lush, with great colors, great quality and overall is an incredible value. I am sure my son is going to love it as well. Who could help but want to wrap up in this robe on chilly winter mornings!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"These shoes were for my fiance. They look great and are comfortable however after not too much wear, the elastic in the back has started to pull or bunch up on the top. That is the only fault with them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Bought this as a last hope for my leather coat... did a great job made the coat look great and was not stiff.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"It is a very good looking watch. It is absolutely fantastic, the design, the material is top notch. I highly recommend it for anyone that want a smart looking watch and very classy :)"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I absolutely love this Black Dome Tungsten Ring.  I wanted to get my hubby a wedding band that is different and unique.  I fell in love with this one, it is solid black and polished.  This ring looks so good and is made very well.

I got a size 9 which fits my hubby perfectly.  I have a ring sizer at home and this ring was sized exactly.  The ring is heavy for a normal ring, but that is expected from a tungsten ring.  He says it fits and rests comfortable on his finger.

Tungsten is a very hard and dense metal.  From the research that I have found, tungsten is ten times harder than 18k gold and four times harder than titanium and twice as hard as steel.  This ring is very durable and will last the test of time.  It has a nice polish and since he has been wearing it, the polish has held up really nicely.  He does a lot of hard labor and nothing has scratched it.

I completely recommend this ring.  I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This review is a 100% my own  opinion and I was not compensated in any way."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I liked it but my wife thought is showed off too much of her boobs.  Definitely very sexy.  The model in the picture is a good representation of what you will get.  If you are big, you will show a lot."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I am an Asian and am 5""3' tall and weigh around 101 pound. I usually wear ""x-small petit"" in the US size. In trying out this cape coat, I can tell this coat is probably made based on Asian size, which means the size would be one to two sizes smaller than the US size. When I live in Taiwan, I usually wore small, and after I moved to the US, I wear x-small petite. So be aware of the size before you purchase this item. I will say go one size up if you follow the US size. For example. If you usually wear small in the US, you probably need to order a size Medium for this coat. I ordered an x-small. It fits, but the shoulder part might be a little bit tight. But I guess a small might be even better for me. The style of this cake coat is simple, cute, and elegant. It will go well with almost anything. It is light weight, and the texture is soft. It is sort of ""thin"" compared to a regular winter coat. It would be good for spring or fall l, but for winter, it will be too thin for me. The quality of the coat is ok. I won't say it is made from very good material. I can tell it might get wrinkled easily (for its thin material) if you do not fold it neatly. Overall, I like this coat. For its price, it is good enough."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,This is so cute! It's perfect for my daughter's first birthday party!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,Would have been 5 stars but fabric is a tad thin and cannot be worn alone.. Needs to be layered or it is see through
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"Seemed to be a tad under 1-1/4"" - I wound up sending it back right away because the fit was a little sloppy on my buckle."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"These are very comfy shoes! I usually wear a 10 and bought a 10 in these and they fit perfectly.  I have medium wide feet and they are roomy and comfortable. The goga mat insole is what makes this shoe I think. It has a really nice rubbery bounce feel under my feet. I have been having problems with my feet hurting from not enough cushion in my old running shoes and these have been a really nice change with my feet not hurting after my walks ( I walk about 5-6 miles a day on gravel trails, and the gravel usually pokes up into the bottom of my shoes and bruises my feet but these protected me pretty good).  I didn't like the looks of this shoe online but purchased it because I was looking for skechers and other brands that have very cushioned rides. These looked better in person than I thought and the mesh look is different looking in person (it seems like it's more of a fabric texture and less of a large mesh material than it looks like in the picture, although they seem breathable enough, they don't have large mesh holes like I originally pictured). I'm still not in love with the way these look, but they are good for taking out on the trails, and it's kind of nice to have a new pair of shoes I don't mind getting dirty (instead of the pretty kind of new shoes that I really only want to save for the gym and places they won't get messed up :)
Overall, definitely happy with these runners."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I hate ordering clothing online, but I took a chance on these and I'm so happy I did!  These are incredibly comfortable and stylish (although the top is an elastic band, so I wouldn't recommend wearing with a short top)  I haven't been able to get rid of my mommy tummy and regular pants were cutting right into it, creating the muffin top and I was really self-conscious about it.  These pants stay in place and keep their shape really well, so I don't have to keep pulling them up and they don't stretch out while I'm wearing them, so no butt sag.  And they really do a great job of keeping my tummy looking flat, but without pinching.  These really are the perfect pants!  I'm currently a size 6 and I could have gone down to a 4 in these, so keep that in mind.  They have a standard inseam, but they're a little short on me, so if you have long legs, also keep that in mind.  I've recommended these to all my friends and I'll be buying more in the future."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"Had many compliments from coworkers. Holds alot of stuff. Great ""cheap"" price from Amazon. Will see how well it holds up, but right now am satisfied with my purchase."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"Garment arrived earlier than expected--a good thing.
Asian XL does fit as US medium but this garment is NOT a slim fit as stated. The sides are straight and don't go in at the waist as the photo shows. The fabric feels soft and has some stretch to it but there is no label with fabric content or washing instructions other than what's stated on Amazon: Hand Wash.
All in all, OK but if it were a slim fit it would be much better."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Fits great doesnt shrink in half lasts much longer than other cheaper shirts
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Way better for the real snow than other popular types of boots. Warm and weather proof!!,)"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,Shirt is not sewn as it should be. Uneven and lopsided sides. Looks like material wasn't cut right and they attempted to sew the mess up. Comfortable but looks awkward on
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"Ordered large.  Received a medium.  Shirt is not as long as portrayed in pic.  I am 5'6"" and want to wear with leggings.  Don't think I would be able to pull it off."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I was looking at similar style in a department store and it cost twice as much if not more...I live in Vancouver, what do you expect!  As a mom. i have to look for something affordable but nice.  The pants suit  my son perfectly..."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,"Too darn tight!  This is not made for adults; they are made for children!  Unless you weight 90 lb with no meat on your bones, these will not fit."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"These boys pajamas are great for my toddler son now that the summer heat is approaching us quickly. These pajamas are made of 100% cotton and wash nicely. They are not the softest pajamas I have purchased for him, but after a couple washes/dries they have already gained a more comfortable feel. They're nice and lightweight for the summer heat. I purchased size 3T for my 34"", 30 pound 18 month old and they fit great with some room to grow in. He typically wears 2T-3T in clothing, so I'd say these are true to size. The shirt is long and narrow - it has a nice fit on my son. I like that this shirt is tag less - my kiddo often tugs at shirts with tags, as his skin is quite sensitive. The shorts come down to his knees and are a ""fitted"" style but a little loose on my boy. I like that in pjs - I feel that would be more comfortable during his sleep. My son enjoys wearing his new pjs and actually pulled them out of his pajama draw to wear when it was time to get ready for bed. He approves!

I was fortunate to have received this product at a discounted price. All of the information provided and opinions and experiences expressed in this review are that of my own.

I hope this review has assisted in your decision making."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,Its cute but it was very small upon arrival and after washing shrank teeny tiny.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Great quality, very well done.  My only complaint, shoes came off my heels. Do not know if my heels are narrow or shoe was made too wide."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"One size too large for me.
Order one size smaller than you normally would."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,This is a really nice....the pendant has some weight to it which I really like and the chain is strong and longer than usual. It was purchased as a substitute for the real thing because I do not wear or take real jewelry pieces with me when I travel.  Received numerous compliments and am finding this is my new FAVORITE.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I've tried several nursing bras and they all are too small or uncomfortable. This one was the best I tried so I went back and bought another.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"It's a beautiful cover up. The only issue is that most cover-ups freely hang in the front to cover you up.... This one kind of pulls to the back back. It's like it won't cover up your frontside at all unless you tie a sash around you. Other than that, it's beautiful and I still wear it at the beach, I just don't really use it to cover my frontside up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,I like the brown earthy color (some may not) and it's a good value on sale. Only complaint is a slight bulge at the bottom of the zipper.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"This might be good for reading by the pool, but the lenses are a little small to work effectively as sunglasses in most other situations.  However, my mild disappointment with this specific pair would not stop me from buying a different pair from this manufacturer and vendor."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"These cheater plugs are great. I ended up buying these cheater plugs because I needed a pair of earrings that I can wear daily and won't poke me in the neck or fall out because of a cheap backing. These earrings fit all of my requirements; they have a nice screw-on back and they are identical front and back so no more neck poking. These cheaters do look like the real thing as well. They fit well and I forget I'm wearing them because they are so comfortable. These are made of surgical steel and feel very well made and seem as though they will hold up well over daily use.

It is important to note that the posts on these are larger than the average stud post so you may have to work to get them in the first time around. Normal earring posts are usually 18g these are 16g.

Edit: After being so pleased with these cheaters I went ahead and purchase this same style in the other colors (black, purple, blue, green and the plain silver ones) I love all of them just as much as my this rose gold one. The colors are all true to the pictures and they all are well made. One thing I should mention is the plain silver pair has a slightly longer post than the rest but it doesn't really bother me.

Since I cannot add reviews for the other ones on their respective pages I will just add the pictures of the others here."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Let me start by saying I'm 70 years,which means I've had a lot of wallets,I mean a LOT of wallets. And so far this seems to be ,hands down the best wallet I've ever owned. Here's why,
It's  well made ,nice looking, and holds everything you need in a wallet, without bulging. Its's not one of those thin wallets that claims it holds everything without bulging out. This wallet holds everything and keeps It's shape. The outside snap compartment is a big plus because you don't have to unzip the wallet every time you use your favorite credit cards. If this wallet is as good as I think it is It might outlast me."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Since we can never have enough umbrellas, I was pleased for the chance to try out the TravelZen umbrella in exchange for my review. {I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion. I'm not affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product, and all comments are based upon my own personal experience with the item. Hopefully my review has helped you make a more informed purchasing decision.}

This is a nifty little compact umbrella, that has a solid, sturdy grip and a loop to keep it close (or to hang up when not in use). It's large enough to keep you dry in a downpour, but then folds up small for easy storage (fits easily into purse, backpack or briefcase). The little ""extra"" with this umbrella is that the fabric cover that you slide over the umbrella when not in use has an outside pocket containing a water-resistant tarp! This means you can protect yourself if having to sit on wet ground, or to cover larger items that don't fit under the umbrella. What a cool touch! I will be keeping this umbrella in my car."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I received my ring today. It looks absolutely gorgeous. Time will tell if it will stand the test of time and still sparkle in a few months
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Not for those of us with long torsos, but great for a halloween costume."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"This are very nice, I had to send them back. I reorder them one size bigger hopefully they fit this time."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Perfect for pendants to be worn at a longer length and on a lovely chain.  I couldn't be more satisfied.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I'm not an audiophile. My golden ears from yesteryear have tarnished rather badly.  I wanted a no-frills subwoofer to balance out my good-but-small bookshelf speakers. The first of these units arrived damaged: the grille had sheared off and could not be reattached. The company was perfect. They told me what to do and sent a replacement unit with no complaint or hassle. It came quickly. The instructions aren't the very clearest, but it didn't take long to figure it out and set it up. One complaint: whoever designed the connector array never, ever tried to connect anything to it. The connectors, even if they were well placed, are hard to use; but they're crammed together such that my not-very-big fingers had a heck of a time connecting the speakers. Much bad language was used. In terms of function, I can set the unit to make much more boom-boom than I want or to be almost silent - or anything in between, including a setting I like. The other speakers are routed through this unit, which ostensibly leads to better balance. Can't prove it by me, but the result seems fine."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The best there is. Uses a DVI video connection, should be HDMI in 2016. That is a little out of date, had to buy an adapter, no problem though. Love it."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Hello people I bought a Nikon p500 great camera and I wanted a carry cad for it and I got this one and it's perfect fit and it's not bad for the price so try it out it really good thank u have a great day
Electronics_5,5,OR,My second one. Hope it is as good as the first.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Very sturdy surge strip for a solid price. Haven't had my house struck by lightning, so I can't comment on the effectiveness, but I'm trusting $1000 of hardware to it."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"nothing special. they produce muddy sound, but for what they are built for they do just fine."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Much more durable than the corresponding Apple case for a fraction of the price.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Did not correctly fit my 20"" screen. If it fit I would have kept it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Works Great. I have two 23"" 16x9 monitors mounted on the stand.  Probably works best with matching monitors.  Might throw the balance off otherwise.  There is no independent monitor height adjustment, so same sized or matching monitors are best.  Works on my glass desk with the stand option."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Helps to keep my Jaybird Bluebuds in ear without the wings, works great, hold up long, don't get too nasty and i just wipe off on shirt if they come out with a friend (sorry gross but it doesn't look dirty afterwards)"
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I bought this for the TTL ... then I realized that the best results can be achieved only in Manual ...
The other problem, it doesn't support HSS which is a mandatory for shooting in the daylight (flash as fill)"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great purchase
Bought this one because the office pull boxes were painful.
This bag is nicely constructed, nice compartments, and even distribution of weight. The wheels roll smoothly. It's not high society style, but perfect for my needs."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Works great ! just be careful of putting to much cleaner on your dash but even with that you have to take corner pretty fast to get this to slide. I would def buy again
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I have 4 tablets; HP G2 10"" android; Dell Venue Pro 8"" windows; Vulcan Excursion 10"" windows and an Ipad Mini-2.  These work on the Ipad about 60% of the presses I make.  The Dell they work on about 1 in 5 times I press it to the surface.  The HP they work about 7 our of 10 times and the Vulcan hardly at all.  I don't know why they act this way.  I have an iHome stylus/pen (looks like a pen with the rubber tip at the top part) and it works 80-100% across all devices.  The company is great, they send follow up emails and the package is nice.  I only received 1 lanyard but it's ok; I didn't contact them to send another.  For me at 7-bucks they're thrown in the drawer and my iHome pen is clipped in my Venue Pro case.  They're built well but just don't work great on any of the 4 tablet devices I have, eh?  Get 'em if you've tried a friends on your device and they work. For me, not so much and if I require another stylus it'll be a 2nd iHome pen/stylus.  Great contact/sales follow-up; product about the cost of a burger lunch and as memorable."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"This was purchase for my girlfriends new 2011 13.3 macbook air. When it was designed I doubt there was any test fitting or any testers before mass producing this. For there are some issues with the bottom piece. When it is fully clipped on the top part hits the screen lid when you lift open then screen which can damage and make marks on the lid. My second issues is the little kick feet. I found them very useful but one is very loose and when carrying or moving the macbook air it makes a annoying clicking noise. On the good note this is a good strong case, light weight, and keeps the thinness of the macbook air looking thin. Until they fix this issues I don't recommend this product due to the annoying flaws."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The specs are pretty self-explanatory. It's fast and has 8 threads, and you can make it faster if you want.  Doesn't come with a CPU cooler like the cheap ones do."
Electronics_5,5,OR,i love this case it has a nice black finish and all components fit comfortably inside with room to spare. It also has ample room for cooling and extras.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"It appears that Arcos has skimped to make this a cheaper model. A MAJOR negative that the potential capacity is really a lot less than perceived. This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all. Skip this unit (however DON'T get a Ipod)."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"great router, easy to set up and use. Really helped my whole network"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Fantastic bag! I looked at and purchased a few other laptop bags from Samsonite, Incase, etc. and nothing comes close to this. They use YKK zippers, have multiple pockets with soft lining to not scratch up laptops, iPads, etc. and this case has plenty of pockets but not too many!"
Electronics_5,3,OR,Was a bit cumbersome to use. Didn't realize I needed the battery pack that stored more charge. Two fully charged batteries died within 10-15 mins of use. I can't totally fault to mount but wish there was some kind of indicator on the adapter to let operator know how much charge left in battery.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Quality items.  I bought these for modding my PS3 60GB PHAT model along with a 120mm fan, to allow more air flow since those original models get hot and the internal fan sounds like a jet engine at highest RPM.

Great seller, and excellent product."
Electronics_5,1,OR,Not comfy at all (on my head at least). Was waaay to tight so I would not recommend these headphones to anyone ever.
Electronics_5,5,OR,has a rubbery feel and and is just the right size for the ipod 5.. a gloss back color.. can be taking on and of with no problems..
Electronics_5,5,OR,I work on alot of computers for people. Never went wrong with APC batteries. Fast shipping and a genuine replacement part. APC has a good reputation and couldn't be happier with my purchase..
Electronics_5,5,OR,I use them almost every day and have no issue to report. Ill never use another product again.
Electronics_5,4,OR,Looks to be of a good quality. I've tested it in and my lab and everything seemed to work properly.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Fit my TP-1a perfectly.
This is as good quality as the original ones that came with my (then) $150 headset (2009).
Great stuff for the price!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I purchased this as my backup/office adapter for you Yoga 13.  The power brick is not as thin as the original adapter, but it is still pretty smart.  It has worked perfectly with my unit.  I would highly recommend getting this if you do not already have a backup to original adapter.

If you already have an older Lenovo adapter or third-party multi-piece AC adapter, I would recommending checking out Patuoxun Power Adapter Cable for ThinkPad X1 Carbon 0B47046 UltraBook PC (this is the Amazon title for the product).  This will likely meet your needs and save you money.  I know it says it works for another specific computer, but you can check out the reviews to see it is universal to other Lenovo laptops."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I really liked this bag the first two times I used it. Plenty of room, comfortable, and seemed pretty secure. However the second time I took it through the airport, one of the front hooks came off. Couldnt find it. Turns out that they're not sewn on. Theyre just hooked on with two small hooks.

Im sitting at the airport halfway through my fourth trip and it seems that Ive lost the other one. Too bad. If the hooks were sewn on this would be a very happy five star review."
Electronics_5,5,OR,No problem so far. They all checked good on my battery checker.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I'm building a terminator. This unit will provide power to the lower voltage systems such as the eyes and its left pinky toe.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"There's a hum that disappears when I turn on my itouch, but it is annoying when I turn it on. But the price was right for the little I use it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I purchased this monopod in anticipation of a week-long vacation. I wanted an alternative for taking photos on day trips where I wouldn't need to lug along my full tripod.  When the monopod arrived, I was amazed at how lightweight the whole ensemble was.  In it's little carrying case, it seemed to weigh less than my cellphone.  Plus, completely collapsed, it fit perfectly into the bottom of my messenger bag.  While taking pictures, the monopod helped tremendously and I barely ever regretted bringing it along.  After the vacation, it stayed in the bottom of my bag and I haven't been bothered by keeping it there.
My only slight minus to the product is the rubber washer that goes between the pod and camera came unglued after the first time I screwed the camera on.  However, I just used cement to put it back in place and everything works fine."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Very Very fantastic camera. Have other full size sensor SLR's and this easily holds its own. The Leica summicron lens with nano coating and digital filter is second to none. Can you say Value? Knew you could. A++++
Really wide angle as well."
Electronics_5,1,OR,"Doesn't seem to work well with Mac devices. My USB 3.0 hard drive keep connecting and disconnecting repeatedly.

The charging ports seem to work fine but the layout of the ports on this are terrible. The right front and rear ports charge and provide connectivity and the front left ports charge only. This is problematic for my desk as the cut through for cable is on the left side.... where the charge only ports are located. Thus, I have to drag cables across my desk to plug them in making my desk look messy. The whole point of this was to allow me to ""hide"" my laptop under the unit, place a monitor on top and then route all of the cables in a clean manner.

I will tinker with it a little more but if I cannot get it to stop this connecting/disconnecting to stop I might have to return the unit and look for another alternative."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"While there's not much to truly get excited over concerning a replacement snap-on lens cap, this one is well designed and does exactly what it should. It is easy to properly secure to the front of the camera lens and stays in place until removed.  I'll give this product ""FIVE"" Amazon stars!"
Electronics_5,2,OR,This speaker stopped working and now it doesn't turn on so I'm returning it
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Installed this system on my '13 corvette, everything works great, I installed the monitor into the sun visor, all the cables were long enough for my car, but probably not for a truck/suv ,camera bracket covers a small part of sticker on license plate may have to trim end off, 170 degree angle is closer to 130 but picture is very clear, for the price this is a great camera monitor system"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This tower is big for a mid tower but I like it

Came warped in plastic

Clean Nice paint job

Cant complain yet great tower!!!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Hit the spot. Needs more fan headers but a stable performer.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Product works Great!!!  I seriously came home seeing a box and I was like, what the hell is this?  Then after opening i couldn't believe this part was already at my door!!  It was seriously there like 12 hours after i ordered it.  Wicked Fast..."
Electronics_5,5,OR,This clock is so cute and durable. I got it for my little girl so it would teach her responsibility in getting up on her own. I love the pink color and how it lights up pink. The covering is pink silicone. You set the time with the two buttons on top and it has the alarm set button on the left side use the hour and minutes buttons along with the alarm set button to set the alarm. You can use the button on the right side to cut the alarm off and on. It also has a snooze light button on top so you can see the time better in the dark. Push the button and the clock will illuminate for about 5 seconds so you can see the time. It runs on 3 AAA batteries (not included). Thank you for taking time to read my review :)
Electronics_5,5,OR,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

Electronics_5,2,OR,"After about 4 months of sporadic problems, I've given up and gone to Netgear's MIMO. This device has been problematic every time the power was recycled. I've done complete resets using the reset button on the back (10 seconds) and the wireless, DHCP just don't work anymore. Can't even access the web based administration page using the 192. 168. 1. 1 address. When it worked range was good, but I have to recomend the Netgear at this point. [."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This was a well made case, good quality for a very reasonable price. It was a gift to hold a portable car dvd player (also a gift) and there is plenty of room for the whole system and plenty also for extras. Very happy with it."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"This item was right in my price range to being practicing with reflectors and diffusers.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I question how long it's gonna last.  It appears to be made similar to a sun shade you'd put in your car windshield to keep the heat down, and I'd imagine the metal will bend out of shape sooner rather than later.  This observation was made on more than one review, but a few people have reported back saying it's going strong.  Bottom line is that even if it does bend out of shape, I can buy 10 more at the same price as one of the higher end kits... so this seems like the best investment.  I would recommend this product!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I really like this backpack. They look nice stylish, have a lot of space too. I can take it any where."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"They are solidly built and are very comfortable to me. However, I'm disappointed with the sound quality. I own a pair&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sennheiser-PXC-450-NoiseGard-Active-Noise-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B000R2PC2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sennheiser PXC 450 NoiseGard Active Noise-Canceling Headphones</a>, which sound great, but wanted the IE6 for when I don't want to carry the bulky PXC450. I was expecting the same great sound fidelity as it is a Sennheiser, but that was not the case. I felt the sound had good bass, but was distorted and lacking a bit on highs. To be sure, in my latest trip I just bought a pair of the very inexpensive&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-MDREX36V-BLU-EX-Earbud-Headphone-Blue/dp/B001EYU3JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony MDREX36V/BLU EX Earbud Headphone (Blue)</a>, and they sounded much better then the IE6 - better clarity and overall balance of lows, mid, and highs, for less than a third of the price! Another problem with the IE6 is that they're too loud (115db/V), meaning you'd need an extra volume control if you plug it into an airplane audio socket. The Sony EX36V already has a volume control built-in, and isolates outside noise better than the IE6. Still not the same sound fidelity as the PXC450, but not bad for less than $30. Go with the Sony EX36V..."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This case is perfect for my new Kindle Fire.  When I first got it I didn't think I was going to like it...I had to get used to holding it while using the tablet and I kept pulling the Kindle out of it while I played games.  However, after a day or two I got used to the case and it looks great and protects my new favorite toy!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I've tried a bunch of cases at this point, and this is by far my favorite. Great fit, high quality materials, lightwieght, overall exactly what I was looking for"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I own a 2005 Cadillac CTS with a Bose system. If I were Bose, I would be ashamed to put my name on it as the factory speakers suck so badly. I replaced the sub with a Kicker and amp and the front door speakers with a pair of Infinity reference 6032cf's I got from Amazon. I went with these as they are 2 ohm just as the system speakers are.

These speakers are incredible! With the sub dialed in to my base level preference the sound system now sounds like it should have with the name BOSE on it.

These speakers are not meant to be a replacement base speaker, however they do an admirable job with it. The two position (0db - 3db)tweeter is phenomenal and the mids are so clear! Since I'm not trying to explode my kidneys or rock the car next to me with too much volume, I am more than pleased with Infinity.

A word of caution here... the Infinity site says that the rear door speakers for the first generation CTS are 6.5""... Do NOT believe it. the rears are 5.25""... I had to return one set 6.5's and I'm waiting for the 5.25's to arrive so I can finish the install.

Amazingly good speakers for the price and Amazon's free freight and fast delivery are great as well."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Cable works great and appears to be of high quality.  My one issue with it is the video wire is thicker than the audio wires, making it stiffer which created a tendency to pull on one of the audio jacks so it would come loose from the plug.  I positioned the cable in a way that provided enough slack in the audio wires, but it was a nuisance to deal with."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great tablet. Ive been using it for a few days now and its had very few hiccups (writing this with the tablet now). Runs smooth and very responsive though i highly recommend the keyboard as typing on a touch screen is a bit less fun than on a real keyboard. The apps are also mostly made for the phone version of android. The build quality is solid and in my opinion better than most ive held. Any complaints about the back being flexible and creaky plastic are hardly noticeable. If anyone is having trouble finding one still, i definitely owe getting mine to nowinstock.net! Worth every star i gave it despite any software flaws (easily fixed by future updates im sure)."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I've had many screen protectors for my various MP3 players and cell phones which gives me lots of basis for comparison.  I feel that this 3M protector is as good as any I've tried, it fits the iPad well.  I personally received two of them, which is good because it usually takes me two tries to get a protector on there perfectly.  The instructions were very specific and clear -- better than other products I've tried.  Overall, I recommend this for use with your iPad!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Nice quality and it worked well for our online wedding ceremony! We set it up on a fireplace mantle behind the officiant and it picked up all our voices well. The mic was hooked up to a hidden Linux netbook that recorded the audio while a camcorder recorded the video. Sound and audio were then fed into a Webex session. No complaints on the audio at all.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Awesome sound for the price. Bought 3 more for  my wife and kids.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I got this to plug my turtle beach headsets into directly for source audio. (px4,xp400) Sounds great, pictures just fine. a must for headset users that need an optical port, ps4 picks up ddigital perfect and no sound lag, which happens with tvs to often, and dint have to keep switching from tv to headset sound on ps3."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Makes my headset a lot more comfortable.  These ear covers seem exactly like the ones that came with the headset originally.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I installed the newest firmware, and DVDs still appear very pixellated. I can watch the same DVDs on my X-Box and they are MUCH clearer. I have both players connected by component cables, but I tried with basic RCA video on a non-HDTV and the pixellation was still horribly apparent. It does play a lot of formats, but I've found that Divx or Xvid usually looks better if I convert it to a DVD using dvdSanta and watch it on the X-box. For your video files not worth a whole dvd, or to fit over 30 hours of 256k quality MP3s on one DVD, it does the job. Maybe with firmware it will get better. Also, its goes real jittery and even the menus flicker spastically if in progressive scan mode. The web site suggests turning off progressive scan mode, yet this is still advertised and labeled as a progressive scan player. Play a lot of stuff for cheap, but it shows. Especially DVDs.... I thought if nothing else DVDs would look good on a Philips player. They look better on my friend's Apex which is cheaper."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"First, I compliment Square Jellyfish staff for responsive and rapid response. My unit didn't have the expected battery inside. They more than compensated me for the inconvenience and were both professional and friendly in their dealings with me. Once powered, the unit operated exactly as promised (read the provided documentation!). The Bluetooth signal reach was at 20 feet, more than adequate for my purposes. Various lanyards and rings (like key rings) work well with the remote. Once I settled on a lanyard and memorized the keypad arrangement, it was useful when I had to operate will keeping my eyes and attention focused on a specific task. Selfies were less blurry because I'm not trying to push the button on the display with my other hand or the/a volume button as an alternate shutter button."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I was reluctant at first to buy a plastic cooling pad but this one actually works quite well. I bought it specifically for the Xbox 360 to cool it down. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap way to cool your laptop  or as I am using it; for my Xbox 360.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Perfect adapters at an unbeatable price.

Remember, these do not step up/down voltage. If your device is 110v (US) and you use these to plug into 220v (EU) it will destroy your device.

Make sure your appliance is rated to the power source, including the frequency (50 or 60Hz, depending on country). Frequency will not immediately destroy your device, but will definitely shorten its life.

Device input power requirements should be on the cord or where it plugs into the body."
Electronics_5,2,OR,We did not have a lot of success with this product. USB devices worked better. As I recall we had some setup problems and well and it's still setting in a drawer in a desk someplace. Would not buy again.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I ordered this weather alert radio from amazon which came in very good time as promised. This radio was being endorsed by our local TV Weather channels as being the top of line and promoting them at various stores in our area. Found out that amazon had this same radio for almost $15 less then what was being offered at the store so bought it. It is very easy to program and set up for any area where you might live and since it comes with a battery back up for power outages discovered we could take it with us for those one day trips for shopping,etc. It works extremely well and recommend it to any one who is weather concerned, mostly for severe storms like tornados. Fortunately we have not had any tornados yet but it sure lets you know loudly when there is any storm alerts in your area. Very good buy, would recommend it highly to all as it could save your life."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I have been using the Centon Electronics Flash Memory Card (S1-SDXU1-64G) for the past few weeks in my Samsung digital camera and also my Sony digital videocamera. This high-performance SD card, with an impressive 64GB of storage, doubled the capacity of my previous SD cards. While not an issue with my digital camera, the card has already eliminated the nuisance of running out of storage on my video camera (with 16GB of internal storage) while traveling/sightseeing.

The Centon SD card eliminates the need to connect either camera directly to my computer in order to download the photos/videos. My iMac has an SD slot but I use a USB SD card reader for my MacBook Pro while traveling. And it is fast, and that means I can take more photos faster... and I also don't have to wait for my video camera in-between shots. In addition to cameras, this Centon SD card is also compatible with some models of Android smartphones.

Two thumbs up for the Centon SD card!"
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Since originally purchasing this when it was in essentially beta testing, they have updated the software many times.  Everything now works great, it seems very accurate and I love the simple look of it.  I had contacted customer service 3 times without every receiving a response (only available via email).  So while it works now, the customer service is non-existent, so I have to knock a star off.

Pros: Look, fit, accuracy, simplicity
Cons: Customer service"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"So far the performance has been amazing. Running a i7-6700k with a Noctua NH-L9I and it idles under 30C and has never gotten over 68C. Will definitely buy again for my next build.

I had enough to do my processor and my girlfriends processor. So you could easily use this to do your CPU & GPU off one tube.

The other processor this was used on was an i5-7400 with a Corsair h80i and it idles at 17-19C. The other PC is SFF so that's why it isn't using water cooling and this one is."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I've used this about 10 times and there are bump galore on all my shots. shooting anything outdoor is dreadful and a lot of post editing is needed. when the cam is on a tripod, I actually lift it by its neck as much as possible (but not suspending the entire unit in the air) so the bumps and shakes are less pronounced. I think the wheels are too small for outdoor use. The ground must be ultra smooth to have it work properly"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Seems to be well made. Terminals are slightly cheap on the inside but look like they will hold up fine. Installed a Skar 12 inch shallow sub in mine with some poly fill on the sides and the setup pounds hard!
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I like it very well, but it doen;t have any preset buttons."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Don't get this if your goal is the secondary temperature gauge.  It doesn't transmit through walls!  So you would have to have the main unit in the house on one side of a window and the receiver somewhere outside mounted but not in the sun, oh and not where it can get wet, oh and not too far away, etc., etc..  There are tons of restrictions about the placement which make the secondary temperature gauge virtually useless.  Who has the PERFECT spot to mount it in relation to the main device?  I thought you could mount the temperature gauge anywhere outside but you can not.  Can't be in the sun, can't get wet, can't have X number of walls or barriers between the main unit and the other gauge.  I actually should have sent it back.  Would not recommend unless you don't care about the second gauge and if that's the case, you can find one cheaper."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I'm commenting here only about a belated experience to remark about the resiliency of this unit to water. In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said ""one of your pockets is in the water"". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order. Call it luck, but patience prevailed in letting natural sunlight and warmth bring it back to life. I'm impressed with this experience."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"The connector on the enclosure seems like it won't last very long and isn't very secure.  It would work well enough if I'm using it at a desk where I'm not moving around much, but I doubt it would work well using my laptop at an airport."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Amazingly comfortable, great sound as well. One of the most well built headphones I have used, even better quality than my 200$ AKG K7XX's, You can wear these things for hours without even noticing you have them on!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Perfect for my intended use. I did not purchase this for anything camera related but rather for my Nintendo 2DS with the Trigger Grip. It fits perfectly and even allows room in the other compartment for 3DS folding headphones and charger. A complete travel pack for my 2DS and accessories.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I have no complaints with this HDMI cable. Tripp Lite products are really starting to impress me in their quality  and performace of their products. Thanks.
Electronics_5,5,OR,This speaker will fill a good sized room and the bass is great. I use it for teaching and the students can always hear the music.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is a great product, I used it on my Samsung Google Chromebook because they do not have an ethernet port all I did was plug and play. With this great product you can use it for any type of Netbook which doesn't come with an ethernet port, with this you will have the access that you need when WiFi is not availible"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Absolutely awesome Mic. I make hundreds of videos. Awesome. Please bye.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Bought this just to be able to use some of my older HDD's without installing them.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Fits and looks good. Practical and offers additional protection. Versatile. Get it you won't be sorry !  The youngins will be very happy, happy, happy, to have one !"
Electronics_5,5,OR,I'm very happy with this 4tb drive - I'm using a two year old iMac with Snow Leopard as my Operating System and haven't experienced any glitches or problems.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Great Binoculars....small enough to carry in a purse and great viewing.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I have owned this camera for 4 years now.

Pros - Beautiful landscapes.
  Amazing outdoor shots and colors
  Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too.
I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'

Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.

I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.

That moving part stopped working a few weeks back. It does not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film cameras bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I was expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years. I am very disappointed that it has become unusable in 4 years.

I would have loved to give this camera at least 4 stars but wanted to give it only 1 for not being durable. Finally I am giving it 2 for at least good 4 years of service. They don't make them like they used to anymore. Will be trying a Nikon next."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT!! Works great and to be able to listen to music with a beanie on in the winter is GREAT! Love the color too!"
Electronics_5,1,OR,"I so wanted to like this TV.  The first one we ordered came damaged but Amazon true to form had the damaged one picked up and a new set in our greedy little hands in under three days.  But why the one star?  Well, the set would turn on without any reason.  It wasn't a problem with other remotes or neighbors remotes, for we live in the country.  Had problems getting to customer service but when we did get them tech was nice and very helpful.  He had me do a Hard Reset.  It worked....until six hours later and it went back to turning on by itself.  I really wanted this set but in the end it was too much of a hassle.  I read many reviews and chose it for cost and star ratings.  We must have gotten one of the few lemons.  I would only recommend this set if you are buying from Amazon as they were great with return."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"These are packaged a bit weird, can be a little bit annoying trying to get these in and out of the container they come in. If you intend to store these elsewhere then there's no problem. I believe I saw these cheaper at HomeDepot and Walmart. But these are still OK priced."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Cool color for a girl.  Ive seen others that cover up the back a little better than this one but other than that it does the job
Electronics_5,1,OR,"From the first time I turned this thing on, it skitzed out. Jumping screens and buttons without even touching the tablet at all. Won't connect to the wireless connection that I know is working because I'm using my iPad on that connection to type this. Even for the money, it's crap. Spend a little more and get something better."
Electronics_5,3,OR,The adhesive works but Quality was bad.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"This little unit pulled me out of a pinch after a failing USB Boot drive. Installed the old hard drive in a couple minutes, booted right up and ran my installer from this. Worked like a charm, was cheap too on price."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Working well so far! Make sure you update the drive Magician software to the latestt version.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Very convenient product.  I love what it does, and the price was right.  Not super HQ, but it doesnt really need to do much, so...."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Got this one as a replacement for another model that arrived in no working condition and it works great.
Electronics_5,5,OR,It was everything I expected it to be. Really happy with this purchase. It was clear and has focus.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"I ordered this to use with my tascam DR-05 audio recorder.  It appears to be a non functioning piece so this was not a good buying experience however due to the low cost I won't bother with trying to return it. I cannot say this wasn't just a faulty unit or whether others have had problems.  I have tried other adapters and experienced the same.problem.  If you need reliability you might just connect your device via the usb connection cable provided by the manufacturer, which is not always a sure thing."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.  I bought 2 other pairs as Christmas presents last year, and now all 3 pairs have failed in one ear.  I tried re-soldering the wires and got 2 of them to work again, who knows for how long.  I have switched to a pair of Ultimate Ears and the quality is even better, hopefully these will last longer."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"The sound is amazing but I can't really make them stay inside my ear, and I've tried all included sizes of the rubber. If you move the cable it ""rubs"" and you can hear it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,works perfectly. the range and sensitivity is what I expect. this product must continuously improve in quality and price. the only concern i have is the screw they use is so soft and easily dugged out by strong screw driver. overall this is highly recommendable.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Very impressed. I am so happy with the details of the this pen. It will be a hit at our Anniversary.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The Milkshake stays nice and cold in this, and feels like you're drinking a milkshake from an authentic fountain - a must have for milkshake or smoothie lovers!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love these pillows! What a great value for two. Every bed should have these. By the way, Bed, Bath and Beyond sells covers for these."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Although a good price, these smell like rotten fish. Brides - beware. Open at least a week before the wedding and separate your petals. I had to spray mine daily and the smell was still not gone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This was a little bit smaller than expected, but it works well for insulating both hot or cold food. I wish there were more styles and colors to choose from for my daughters."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Save a ton by using these instead of paper towels!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The plates are okay.  We ordered 2 boxes (12 plates total), and both boxes snapped open during shipping, chipping the edge of one plate.  The Black circular imprint is well done, but not quite centered in the plates, and each plate exhibits some 'uniqueness' in shape.  They are fine for our purpose and the price is certainly nice.  Was hoping for more here, but you do get what you pay for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I wanted a good sturdy slip cover to protect my chairs from kids.  These do that job well.  They get dirty, but they are easy to take on and off and wash up in the washing machine really well.  I'd buy them again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Went together OK and looks good in the corner. The color is very dark
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Tore apart easier than toilet paper. Its so cheaply put together. Do not waste your time and money.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are the handiest hangers for drying undergarments. I absolutely LOVE them. They take up very little room and can be hung anywhere. I'm going to buy several more sets to give to my daughters.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is a great quality product and fits in nicely with our kitchen. It's a sturdy product that holds a ton of stuff and does the job! Would recommend.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are great for starting charcoal in the grill.  Burn long enough to get a good coal going.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The ""polish"" already shows lots of scratches, though I can not tell if it is that or the steel itself.  The thick glass lids are very good, and they actually can match other pans and visa versa.  There's very little problem with food sticking after light use.
Three Stars because there is evidence of being stained from the electric stove, so they are not in fact ""stainless"" as suggested."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great item, I purchased this to add to my collection of heart shaped pans in preparation for Valentine's day. Now I have three different sizes that gives me more options for decorating. This is the standard Wilton pan material but in a heart shaped. It's the smallest size and light weight aluminum material. It is a light color pan, not the dark colored. It will work well for making heart shaped cakes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Worked great!! A little hard to fold into the box !! But they looked great and stayed put once it was accomplished!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,So much on a  dinner table. we really enjoy this and have ordered several for wedding gifts
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Fun ornament. Very well made with a great attention to detail. Good size too. It is a gift for my brother, who likes quirky ornaments and I'm sure he will love it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I didn't even know I needed this bottle opener, and now I'm obsessed. Always conveniently located right on the fridge, but small enough that it's not tacky. Our friends always comment on how handy it is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I was quite disappointed in this. The picture of the comforter and pillow covers is what I excepted to get.
Instead you get a large cover for your comforter to go into. It is very soft but thin. It is not a comforter as shown in the picture. You also get 2 pillow covers. I also thought I was getting gray and I got all white. I did get this at a reduced rate but I would not purchase this again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Little smaller than I anticipated but it is perfect for what I ordered it for . Very light weight and easy to hang.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Love these bottles. Had a problem one was broken and the seller was easy to deal and replaced the broken bottle no problem. I would definitely buy again
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My wife and I have already made multiple batches of gummies with this product. I was afraid the dropper to fill them wasn't going to work, however I was very pleased. After letting them sit up they popped right out and were delicious!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My Grandsons are huge Mario & Luigi fans.  These are beautifully detailed, bold colors, soft, and comfy.  They loved them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Love the print and color of these rugs but they are very very thin. Great accent pieces but the runner is an unusual size and the small area rug is very small.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,I bought this to cook brown rice...It takes a LONG time to cook! It also takes up a LOT of space on my counter.  Not sure I'll use it all that much for fact.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt. A redesign where filter is attached directly to motor housing with positive and fool proof installation would solve this problem. Other than this problem a really great product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This Next-shine digital scale is super cute!!! I have wanted to have a smaller scale around the house for some time now.. For mailing things out, weighing food ect. I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

* I received this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. These opinions are my own and have not been influenced by anyone for any reason!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I used it today and it worked wonderfully. I put the unit in the refrigerator in my lunch bag so I could grab and go with morning.  My homemade soup was nice and warm by lunch time.  No more waiting for the microwave, how nice is that.  I'm going to do pasta dishes next.  I'm really glad this is part of my lunch gear.  It works well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Pretty but not functional. Fabric is too light and it doesn't stay in place whatsoever no matter how often you adjust it. Give it 3-stars due to the description being accurate and loving the color
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Exactly what I wanted.  My old sifter was the squeeze handle type and around 52 years old.  Right now using that type is difficult.  This is compact and works perfectly plus you get the plastic lids.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great cup. Will last forever. Keeps things cool / warm.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"after checking all over for the perfect toaster, we found this one. It toasts to each family members likes. Easy to use, toasts large pieces bread.  Plug is in frount , little inconvienent, but can live with it. Amazon had the best price. would recomend this toaster"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,i did half of my polo shirt and almost used half of the tank. It works though so i am good.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This item has one function, and doesn't hold up to that function. The sides of the ball don't close tight enough to prevent little particles of tea getting into your water. Don't buy it, get something else."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,Great chair however the left arm broke off after a few months. I fixed it with gorilla glue. Pretty disappointed in the quality.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"magnet doesn't have much strength so really cant be used that way,I was going to send it back until I found a way to wedge it into a cupboard and now its a wee bit better,the alarm works well and is easy to use"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"It is my second Primula Espresso Coffee Maker. I should say that the quality went down significantly. The previous one had rubber gasket between upper and lower parts, this one has cheap plastic stuff which leaks when you pour the hot coffee. It is very unpleasant experience. Top portion of the maker has also deteriorated from the previous model. Hadn't I trashed the original box, I would have returned the maker after the very first use.

Ordered a rubber gasket to replace the original plastic one.

Update: the maker was returned as the quality of the product was below expectations. Rate was changed from 2 stars to 1. Not recommended for purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"After using this for the past year or so, some if the clips are starting fall off kind of easily.  No big deal, just push it right back on the rope.  For the price, it's definitely worth it.  Great for display if you don't plan on taking your hats on and off of it much."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Interface could be slightly more intuitive but after pushing buttons several times you'll figure it out.  Nice having two different thermometers to check different parts of the meat.  I use this for cooking in the oven.  I leave the timer outside and put the meat in with the thermometers and this works fine.  I didn't see a way to set the timers to a specific temperature other than the presets, rare, medium rare, for the meat type.  Its not really a problem though, I really just wanted a way to see where the meat was at without opening the oven and/or cutting into it and also to set a timer just in case I forget.  I'd recommend this, I've used it a couple times now without issue.  There is an on/off switch too which should help with the battery."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a home roaster and use this filter after brewing coffee in a pan on the stove (4 minutes at 190-200 degrees).  I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great quality.  They handle heat well and are nice and thick.  They can be used for opening jars and bottles as well.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am soooo glad I had this on our last cruise; I have never had such watered down drinks  I would leave the bar with their glass, and add my own alcohol."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought a  couple of the duvet covers and they are so nice,  silky  and soft."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love them, just thought they would be a bit bigger!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This works just as well as my old Kitchen-aid mixer did and it's not as cumbersome. My only suggestion to the manufacturer is it needs a bowl with a handle.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I purchased this for new furniture that will be delivered later this week.  I am used to leather but this time purchased microfiber. Was worried about the dog getting on the recliner and getting it dirty.  Will post a later review on how it works out once furniture is delivered.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is a very low napped rug. I thought it was gray and white but it looks more like gray and cream. I have it in a high traffic area and its easy to keep clean. Im very happy with this.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"No, I am not paid by Pyrex, but I do think their glassware is wonderful. That could be due to the fact I spent 15 years reusing Chinese food containers and infomercial Tupperware, so perhaps the bar was set low, but I have used this 14 piece set at least seventy times and have had no breaks in the glass despite a couple of drops. I have also ran them through the dishwasher dozens of times without a single problem. Recommended to anyone who is tired of using old cheap storage containers."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This vac works really well, but there is a flaw with the handle in that the unit is not balanced well and tips over breaking the handle.  We have fixed it 3 times already with glue and duct tape.  Those did not work.  Finally, we wrapped the broken handle with Gorilla brand tape and it has held together for many months now.  Love the vac and have used it for a few years, already."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Do not believe the ""highlights"" - these are the roughest pillow cases I have ever had.  Plus, they are no larger than the ""regular' ones that come with sheet sets.  I bought them based on the reviews and that they were supposed to be larger and soft...they are neither.

I am a little shocked because the reviews were so good.  Do keep in mind I am highly sensitive and perhaps a ""normal"" person would think these are soft...but size...I laid them out on top of the other pillow cases I own and there is no difference at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Solid, easy to put together, and the pieces snap into place and are moveable too. A good buy. I'm using this as art room storage, and I've bought Seville before, will buy again. The only negative is the packaging, it's a bit hard to get open, but once you've gotten through that it's easy to put together and solid useful storage. A good buy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Update, my last 5 containers were bent on each end which made my cupcakes lean. So happen I just ordered from Websturant and was able to use the new ones."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This rug is GORGEOUS! I've had it for a few weeks but have yet to place it on my kitchen floor.  My kitchen colors are the same as the rug.  It's of good quality; no hidden odors and just nice to look at it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This DII Halloween Skeleton table runner looks really cool. I am using in the classroom when we study the human skeleton system or during Halloween week. However it came wrinkled, so I need to iron it prior to use and will likely hang it up a wall or in front of a book shelve. Also, I prefer that the tablecloths have a polyester blend to it so that they do not shrink in the dryer or wrinkle so easily and apparent. This is slightly see through and has only one stitching, so don't expect to last long, at-least wash it in the gentle cycle."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Product is of fine craftsmanship.  Sturdy and attractive and substantial.  Delivery was prompt.  I'd buy another if needed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are *much* smaller than I expected, but they also come with their own little stand to hold the sticks while they burn.  I'll say that breaks even and give them 5 stars, because they smell great (not too overpowering)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I got these as a gift for my son.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,i saw these used on a recent cruise.  they were a must have.  will try them out at the pool on windy days.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Gave them several tries. Made sure tile was clean, suction cups were clean, suction properly applied. No go. Cannot recommend. They're in the trash."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,The stand is perfect for raising the TV enough to be able to place the Blue-Ray player underneath.  The setup looks nicely organized and neat.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"They are affordable and easy to use. The quality is excellent for the price! I've used this product for ~1 year now, and no bag has ever teared on me while decorating sweets.
They fit well with all of the piping tips I have, including couplers. The seam on the side of the bag makes it easy to mark and cut!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I needed a gift for someone I see socially and yet keep it light and kind of funny.  Knowing she loves wine and has a great sense of humor...this was perfect.  She loved it and it really does look a little more expensive than it is and also I love to personalize a gift and this fit into all categories.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Very small but works if you don't have a lot of space.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We bought this board for pre-photo prep for a collection of 4-6"" dolls. This board is useful for a tabletop, counter, or other work surface. Well padded and narrow end allows us to get to tiny costume areas."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"really good.  not a size that fits a normal tissue box, so i took tissues out and put them in this box alone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is wonderful.  Heat from the bottom while sleeping is a more restful night's sleep.  I have arthritis and wake up stiff, not with this new heated mattress pad. We are very pleased."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,a nice secondary vacuum for small apartments and reaching tight areas
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Good quality, nice material and appearance, good thermal properties, pretty much as advertised but I have had more effective blackout curtains."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I bought these for my office which has windows that are very awkward in size. I did really like the curtains, although they didn't really look like the picture when they were hung. The only thing I really didn't like was the ""moss"" color; it was not flattering at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Bought this for the sleeper couch in our RV.  It's pretty thin but still seems to work great and it stores beneath the couch so it's out of the way.  It hasn't been tried out for a full night's sleep yet.  The cover and straps are nice.  It's almost a perfect fit, just a tad short."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is a beautiful clock that sits on a shelf in my entertainment center. The quality is good and I am very pleased with my purchase.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,I was surprised when I went to use it there was not any markings for 1/2 or 1/4 cups.  Therefore the 3 stars.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This flask is awesome. It took me a little bit to figure out where the shot glass was but after looking at the pictures on amazon i figured it out and quickly got the shot glass free from the flask. I love that the shot glass is collapsible you can this flask anywhere and have a shot. The flask is sturdy no leakage when tipped upside down which is a big plus. The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night. Love the colors black and silver not to much but just the right beauty. All around this flask is great. Would make an excellent gift for fathers day or birthdays. I received this product for my honest review.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This has survived 2 years and many washings and
still looks great.
I will surely buy another, if it ever looks scruffy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I really like these. Rounded stick that isn't too heavy and is very easy to handle. Comes in two sleeve punches that are nice to have, too. Cleans easy in the dishwasher. Glad I bought them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I needed a frame to put my king size matress on to get it up off the floor. I didn't have a box spring so I needed something with support. I was on a budget so after much shopping I decided this was the frame for me. I worried somewhat about putting it together as my husband, although multi talented has little patients for cheap products. Come Mother's Day we set to putting it together. My oldest daughter stepped up to help. What a surprise. They had it put together in less than an hour with no fuss or cuss. lol My husband has a helpful hint, when putting the wooden slats in don't tighten the middle support beam completely. This allows the slats to snap in with no effort. Just remember to tighten the middle support after attaching all the wooden slats. Also use your own wrench, the supplied one is of no use. The proper size is a metric #12 wrench. Ok, bed is up, now comes the true test. I am a big woman, weighting around 275 on a good day. Well, the bed didn't even creak when I laid down on it. I am also a restless sleeper so I toss and turn alot, bed is doing great. Several weeks after using my new bed, my neice and her boy friend came for an overnight visit. Now I don't know thier exact weights but I can say that the combined total was over the 600lbs. limit for the bed. I was worried but I love my neice and would never hurt her feelings for any reason. Not a problem, they spent 2 nights on it, and not one broken slat. Now I will be honest, I am not sure how this  bed would hold up if I had owned it in my younger days, back when we were ""getting busy""  on a regular basis, but I would highly recommend it for a bed that is used for sleeping!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Cheese cloth was brand new, arrived in great condition. Excellently made. I use it for making loose leaf tea. Would recommend to others."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Never used one of these before this purchase . Not sure how I got along without it all this time. These things are great!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Want to reach the last little bit that's waaaay down at the bottom of that jar?  This Norpro Silicone Jar/Icing Spatula does just that; cleanly scrapes up remaining morsels even in narrow jars because of its slim size. As far as icing is concerned; haven't had an easier time of frosting cakes or cupcakes since purchasing this product; smooth application, manoeuverable, fits right down into the hole of angel food cakes!  Great for smoothing the frosting, creating peaks and swirls."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"DO NOT BUY! Scam. Only one glove received instead of two. They are not as heat resistant as claimed. Burned my hand while removing hot pan from oven. Heat from pan went right through glove. Interesting that this product has all these negative reviews, yet it has a 4 star rating. Hmmm . . ."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love these.  Definitely a great purchase.  I keep parrots in my home and burning candles are often toxic to the birds.  I saw candles like these on a recent trip to Costa Rica and was really glad to find them here on Amazon.  They truly look like real burning wax candles.  The added bonus is the timer that turns them on for several hours, and then off again.  I highly recommend these."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I needed white balloons specifically for a birthday party craft.  When these arrived, I was a little concerned because they looked very yellow.  I decided to give it a try and blow one up.  They're pretty much clear balloons with a yellowish tinge and a little shine.  If I held the balloon near a book I could comfortably read through the balloon.  I don't know if I was accidentally given the wrong color but the sticker stuck to my bag claims they're white pearlized balloons.  Honestly, I don't know what I would call the color and I don't picture anybody going to a party store and voluntarily choosing this color.  They look like they should have been clear balloons with a bit of shine to them but they look aged and yellowed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,My car smells no different after 3 weeks.  Snake oil.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Other than that, what's there to complain about?
The new version of the product has a plastic sleeve that gives a more accurate temperature reading but why care when it takes all day to chill the bottle of white? It is unbelievably noisy when operating and couldn't possibly be used any place you want to have a conversation. If you put your white wine in the refrigerator to bring it close to serving temp and then put it in the chiller it might work to your advantage (the unit won't be on very long) but this thing is not worth whatever you're going to pay for it. BTW, there's now a 2-bottle version. It doesn't work any better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I literally use this blender every day. It has replaced most all of my kitchen appliances!

We have no problems with chunky smoothies on the 1st try. We put carrot chunks, frozen spinach, giant chunks of frozen raspberries and they liquefy no problem. My toddler drinks her smoothies thru a sippy cup! I love that I can add fruits and veggies and even avocado for extra nutrition and they slurp it right up!

It chops nuts and veggies for easy cooking prep.

I make batter and dough in it effortlessly several times a week. We eat Paleo/gluten free, so I make most all muffins, cookies, cakes & breads from scratch. We even make homemade Lara bars in seconds!

The preprogrammed buttons apply to most everything you would want to do.

A Spatula can scrape out under the blades and get out every last bit (unlike Vitamix)

It fits under my kitchen cabinet (unlike Vitamix)

The blades are not sharp so no worry about you or your kids getting cut and they never dull (unlike Vitamix)

The recipe book is great a great guide for most anything you may want to do with this awesome blender!

8 year warranty and from what the rep (at Costco) said it's an easy process if needed

The best part may be the clean up. A cup or 2 of water and a few drops and let it rip. The cup is all one piece, so you don't have to take it apart to wash and then put it all back together again.

One thing to know in deciding between the 4-side and wild side cup, the wildside is bigger so makes more, but requires a bit more volume to work correctly, so if you want to make smaller smoothies or batches of batters you may prefer the 4 side cup."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Update: this pillow is the best Ive ever had. It is like no other pregnancy pillow. This will help you fall asleep in an instant. We keep the room freezing cold so the pillow case doesnt stick to me and it feels silky. I cannot sleep without this pillow. I wish I had bought it for my first pregnancy too.

Old: This pillow has been amazing so far. Day two of me having it and I'm
Actually able to get a full nights sleep."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Absolutely love the quality, color and price. The cat seems to have taken to it so I bought a matching cat bed from Amazon for the kitty."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Received this as a gift. My pots and pans have a lip on them and was afraid the clips wouldn't go on, but they did and are very snug. I had to take off 1 star because when I opened it from the box, it had a chemical smell. I washed it, and it still has the smell."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I use to make beer can chicken on the smoker.  Cleans up easily.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Plastic a little flimsy but it does hold many photos and keeps them safe
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great scent. It's fruity but no too sweet. One small cube is enough to spread through and entire 2 story 1800 sqft house
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."

I currently have a wooden Lime & Lemon squeezer. That one is great for certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One for the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl for the Lemon. For some people, that is just extra work and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to color coded to match.

Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer works by pushing the Lime or Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not work and Lime or Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.

I have uploaded some Images and Video to Amazon that might not show up right away. Amazon has since change the way how they process these and when it will show up on the reviews. Please be patience. Thank You.

I purchase this at a discount price for an honest & unbiased review. (I know you hate to read that part, but my review are always honest, if the product is not good, then it won't get the stars it deserve)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a fine cabinet. The wood looks pretty good. The hardware is pretty good. I was just surprised by how much the low-level assembly is needed. I mean, giving me a packet of seeds for Poplar trees, grow the trees, cut them down, and saw the trunk into boards was a little bit too much.  At least IKEA would give you a template for how to saw the trunk into boards, and IKEA includes the chainsaw you need."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Some how I changed the filter with this but indication for carbon on machine never go away
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Works great and less than the shark brand! wiil and have bought again
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Without giving anything away this story is an up and down ride of emotions and choices. While I would have liked to have a more uplifting ending, it was still a good read."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Pretty simple recipes. All can be found online. These are simple, oils & butters only. None that require a preservative or water or emulsfying wax"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This is yet another great addition to the Back-Up series and I loved reading this! The full range of emotions are covered here and I loved how well everything rounded out with this novella. Reading this entire series has been a great adventure filled with complex characters, an incredible storyline and an author that always leaves me wanting more. I highly recommend reading this to anyone and I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I picked this book up free on Amazon. It was well worth the price I paid LOL!

It was an okay book. It read quickly and was intriguing even if a little predictable. The writing was okay. There was decent character development. If you are looking for a quick, fast read, this could satisfy that need."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Great story.  Only negative observation is that it was a novella.  Keep 'em coming, Mr. Rollins."
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,Story line was easy to follow. Plot was good.characters  we're good.  Should have been longer. Recommend to others to read.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I was quite spell-bound about this book. God uses ordinary people to do extraordinary things. The lessons learned indicate that God is so alive today and speaks through his Word. Why did God use this child, one would want to know, but God uses us everyday to share his word. We are sometimes afraid to speak to others concerning how God works. I went to the website and listened to Ms. Brown share the story. As the story progressed, the reader is praying for a miracle to take place and Tara is healed completely but God had different plans."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The best part about the 3rd installment of the IMA series is that it looks like it's not going to be a trilogy! The ending definitely sets things up for a continuation and that means more of my favorite fictional couple!

Locked and Loaded picks up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina's first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she wants him"" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him ""Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn't work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters. (More hot sex and detailed fetish exploration would not be remiss either."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,I really liked this mail order bride book. It was a nice clean romance book. I would recommend this book to all my family and friends
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Wipes brow and has a cold shower! Holy hotness, sugary female sweetness with a little bit of alpha male to thicken the mix!!

I love me some lady love with a man in the mix but for some reason well written FFM m&eacute;nage is a hard find.

On my search I stumbled across this 'freebie' so nabbed it. Not only did it deliver on FFM but also panty wetting smoking hot FFMF!

Emme was a new to me author, but no longer...scurries off to check out more of her work!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Sometimes I want a good, short, read, and this one did the trick.  I tried to guess all the way through who the arsonist might be.. I read a lot of suspense and usually have a suspect in mind.  Not so with this book.  The romance between Carlisle and Chet, as well as Mike and Kelly was wholesome and cute.  I loved the sixty-something Violet and her boyfriend with the bat. You can't go wrong with this one."
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"Maybe it was just me, but the way this one was written made it really hard for me to get into the story.  I was constantly sighing, rolling my eyes and thinking ""really, please tell you you did NOT just say that!"".  The romance was a one-day instalove that was so corny it wasn't entertaining, believable or even likeable.  The ""fight scenes"" were a joke (it was like watching a movie fight where the camera is pointed at their feet) .....sounds terrible right?  It was! There was no incentive to read another book at all."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"She is a saint I pray with each day, for her intercession for special intentions. Our parish Church and community  is named after this great saint."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Loved the characters, loved the story, loved the sweet romance.  Innocence personified in its entirety.  Can't wait to read more from this author."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,Things are starting to heat up now and secrets are coming out. Will he reveal all of them and is he really falling for her or is it just a ruse. I'm intrigued to find out.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I loved the story and even tho it bogged down a bit in the middle I enjoyed it and wanted to keep reading the next story.
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"While I thought the likelihood of two people quickly falling for each other after 14 years of never seeing each other and not having any contact with each other prior to their marriage of convenience infinitely small, I somehow still enjoyed this. The setting was peaceful, the lead characters were likeable, and the children were adorable. A fluffy, angst-free escape if you don't think hard about the plot."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I have loved H since Nineteen. I always knew he was someone special. I laughed at his antics, cried at his struggle, then basked in triumph over Big C! Now I get to see him fall in love! This was what I wanted for him; this is what he deserves! And what a great partner for him. I love a strong woman, and  Lilac does not disappoint.

This is my favorite book in this series so far. I recommend this book...highly! You will love it! You will love Lilah from the the top of her head, to the end off AllyTastic, and Harry from his heart to his Davidson!  Absolutely wonderful!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is one I hope never ends! The author is gifted, her stories come to life and they've managed to take over mine lately!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,This book is unusual to say the least. The beginning keeps you guessing for a while as strange events start to happen to Evie. You start to get little hints about what is happening until your teased with thoughts of the greek gods. What happens when the gods are threatened? well there is an unusual theory in this book. My curiosity kept me going and by the end I found myself really interested in what was going to happen to poor Evie. Is she going to make it? Will she come to terms with what is happening to her or will her mortal body fail? I guess I'm going to have to find out lol. There is explicit adult content and violence.
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Its a good book. I enjoyed it, but there's a lot of missing words in the book. It must b something with ebooks. I read a lot, and I'he noticed ebooks have a lot of missing words. All in all tho, this series was a good a good read!"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Wow this is a scorching hot short story, and so true how many times have I talked to others in the book club about this kind of stuff. Amazing can't wait to read the next book."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,This book was a very heartwarming book!! I hope she turns it into a series! All the books by Hazel Gower that I read I have absolutely loved.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Not disappointed at all. This series gets better and better. I just love it. No, i adore it! It's amazing! I've been waiting for quite some time For Brandon's story and it was perfect. Just as i imagined it would be :) love these guys. They are all soooo good :)"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Ceony thought that the danger was over. She saved the magician she was apprenticing and put an end to the threat. She didn't expect to be targeted for revenge for what she did. She also didn't expect to have to hide a budding relationship with her mentor from everybody around her.

I have to be very honest, when I first started reading this book, I was trying to figure out why there was a need for sequels. Then it all hit at once and I fell into the story without another thought. It may have a very slow start, but the buildup behind it is amazing!

The narrator was as amazing in this as she was the first book. I really adored her. I'd love to listen to more books by this narrator. The story was good itself, but she enhanced it even more and brought life to all of the characters.

I do recommend this book very strongly. However, I recommend that the reader read the first book before picking this book up. Many references are made to the first book that may cause a reader who didn't read it to be very confused and not as interested in the story as they would be if they read the first."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Instantly hot, the plot draws you in and learn something new in every line. Well written, and very satisfying. Cannot wait for part two."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"While it was a fairly short story, it did tie up a lot of loose ends and allow us to finish up Ethan's story.  I really enjoyed it and am so looking forward to the continuation of the KGI series.  I haven't missed one yet and don't plan to start any time soon.  The books are well written and all of the characters that weave through all the stories are now like old friends.  It is always nice to be able to keep up with everyone, even if it is only a few words about what they are doing currently."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Any author who wants to include magic in their stories has go think of a consistent magic system unless s/he wants to be inundated with sneering letters from readers who love to pick things apart. K M
Shea combines recognizable  elements to good effect: the ability to read things into life (Inkheart), a magic council (too many to name), and magic law enforcement(ibid). The story move along a good pace and the characters are enjoyable."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This book was short but very sweet,  a fun ghostly tale that I won't soon forget. I did not see the end coming the way it did, shocked!  But what a wonderful story."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,Love the book and the characters. It was very interesting. I would recommend this to anyone with an opened mine. Hope to that there is more to come
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"A good read. Learning to over come your fears is a task all it's own. And Samantha has to learn the hard way. This character is stubborn! But she's also fun. Pretty good read,would be a good weekend quicki"

If he thought things were a bit strange with the widow's phone call, the police warning him off and escorting him out of town before he has a chance to see anyone, well now Bill has to stay and figure things out for himself. And boy does he ever get himself entangled in a lot of strange stuff along the way.

If you enjoyed ""The Last Call"" or ""Capitol Offense"" then you will really enjoy going on another thrill ride with Bill Travis.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Love Kimberly Rae Jordan's books!  Filled with great story line, how God's works  in lives, and every book is an enjoyable read!  Especially enjoy the series ..."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"There is something so hot about a southern man. This story drew me in right away. It was sexy and fun, and I like the characters a lot. I would recommend it to anyone. I look forward to reading more from this author!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Save Me is about Courtney Pierce and Rachel Sanders story. ""Her long neck is perfect for licks and nibbles and that's not even the half of it. That face, with her cupid's bow lips, long straight thin nose, high, arched brows the same shade as her hair, and brown eyes so warm I could drink them like hot cocoa. Her long brown hair is down, with a little bit of wave and it frames her face, making the perfect window. "" ~Courtney Pierce

Through the first two books comes together to bring in Court's POV and you will find out what happened between him and Annabella and things will come to light between Court and Rachel. Break Me ended in a small cliffy to start this book up with Rachel finding out she is pregnant. Is it Kellan's or someone's else?  No spoilers here so you will just have to see. I really loved this book and finding out more info on Ashley, Victor, Annabella and several unexpected twists to be revealed. Of course, you will have plenty of swoon worthy moments and angst to hold you over. Don't forget about the betrayal and enough steamy scenes to make up for it. I love this series! I reread them every time I have a chance to read the next book when it comes out!  Hope you enjoy!

""I might be gorgeous, to you anyway, but you have these eyes and it's like looking into a deep green pool and getting lost. Plus, this body, oh my god, this body. I could worship at your body.

It's like, so intense to be around you and it's all I can do to breathe."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Oh my. Where to begin. Loved it. The book made me know my friend a bit better. I related to the Cerritos, so easily. Love the way they interact. The. Body language. The way to people can know, just by looking that something is off. Must read. The way she finds her footing in life is amazing. Nat I think I have a Cruz "
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Good characters, well-written with good story plot and one very busy professional lady involved in many things. Her life was hectic with a strange type of love life that most women would not appreciate. Women want answers and stability. Good book to read and you will enjoy the heroine who does not seem to have much joy in her life."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,What could he possibly be thinking? What the hell is she thinking? As you can tell I just want to punch both of them! Going to the next book!
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This book is just what I wanted to get a result.
The Strategy of the 7 Steps to Succeed in increasing muscle are really simple but very complete. The author has explained in detail how to train both the field of psychology and body. I think to put into practice his advice is easy and effective. Read also carefully Bonus Chapters because they gave me many useful ideas and practical information!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,This is a game for those who want brain exercise.  It's fun and challenging.  It's a different kind of word game!
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Kian goes from being a playboy and ""the spare"" to Crown Prince in the blink of an eye when his twin brothe, Garrett, is kidnapped. For three agonizing months he's been drowning in fear and sorrow over his brother's plight yet having to put on his princely face and perform his princely duty. He's just about reached his breaking point when Savvy stumbles, lierally, into his life. She goes from saving him from a handsy title seeking woman and her daughter to saving his sanity. Savannah Breslin has ""been there, done a prince before"" routine and it broke her heart. She wants to protect her heart but being with His Royal Hotness breaks down her defenses. In turn Savvy becomes his anchor in the tumultuous storm of his brother's disappearance.  Duty keeps calling Kian away and his brother is finally rescued it seems he's pulled away from her more. Even though he's told her he loves her, she believes that they will never have a future because she is an American commoner. So she runs away to protect herself and deal with her breaking heart. Kian finds her and declares his love again backing it up with proposing. It seems this time she will get her prince and her happily ever after.

Tracy Wolff did a great job in combining two storylines: the hot and heavy romance of Kian and Savvy and Kian's journey through the kidnapping and rescue of Garrett. As Kian experiences the angst, anger, rage and impotence of not being able to find his twin, the reader experiences the poer of those feelings right along with him. The sizzle between Savvy and Kian is palpable and practically leaps of the page. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and am looking forwarx to reading Garrett's story.."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"As with all your devotion books, this one did not disappoint! Great read!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I really, really liked this book although there were some grammatical errors. I have read it over and over as well as the volume that follows it."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Wow, book 2 in the Desert Guard series is even better than the 1st.  This is Miles & Hank's story, and it is filled with action, twists, self-discovery, determination and of course, a cute kid. I really liked that the characters are so real, complex and full of emotion.  I love the interplay between all the characters and the meddling of the goddesses.  I am so looking forward to Sean & Hannah's story and am impatient to read what I expect to be as good as the last two.  I also hope this world's stories continue as I want to read more about Tito, the children & even the fallen.
Review copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,Love the MC books by this author. Every one of them are extremely well written and keeps you engaged from start to finish. Ready for the next book.
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"Instead of just telling the story this author is forcing conflict between the main characters.  Advice to the author:  Go read Nalini Singh's Archangel series and get an education on anti-heroes.
My synopsis:  Supposedly mature adults in love acting like spoiled children with no hope of growing up.  Very frustrating read."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This complex novel, part science fiction, part alternate history, plays with ideas about the true nature of consciousness. It takes the reader into the minds of various real and imagined beings, including destroyers such as Francisco Pizarro, a son of Genghis Khan, and the Black Plague, as well as adherents of crackpot theories such as the Vril and orgone energy, and the mind of woman with schizophrenia. Historic figures, including Freud, Einstein, and Hitler also make their appearances.

If you enjoy the imaginations, mind games, and broad canvases of authors  like Umberto Eco or Philip K. Dick, you might enjoy this book. It doesn't quite reach their full heights of imagination, but it's still an intriguing exploration."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"In ""His (A Dark Erotic Romance Novel)"" we meet Kat and Gavriel. Kat is a college student who is working at the college library and is dared to kiss the first hot guy she sees, which happens to be Gavriel. This dare leads to her following him home and witnessing something no one was ever meant to witness. Admitted serial killer Gavriel doesn't expect to see the young woman who kissed him out of the blue at the library to be peeping in his windows and interrupting his pre-meditated murder, but when she does he has no choice - he has to keep her or kill her.

The plot had an interesting twist to the normal kidnap dark romance, which I enjoyed. I enjoyed both characters and liked that the author told the story from both POV. The chemistry between the characters was hot and the sex scenes hotter. This story hits a nice balance where it is dark enough that it should satisfy those with a interest in dark romance, but not so dark as to turn off the regular romantic suspense readers.

Overall, a recommended read."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I loved the book and storyline.  I encourage you to read it too!  I've been very pleased with the selection on the free section!  I have found many new authors this way!
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I loved this book from start to finish. Have you ever wanted to hug someone and choke them in the same breathe ? Well I did several times. Zack was the hurt lost soul and it took Kate to bring him out of the darkness. This book will make you cry laugh and then melt as you fall in love with Zack and Kate..
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,Dream and Bump is the perfect power couple. They are getting it together and Dream is holding shyt sown while still in school. This novel is flowing nonstop and I'm lovin it!
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Ebony Bell is not your typical witch she helps the authorities human and non. Solve issues the human world cannot learn of or handle if they did learn of it. The book has plenty of twists and turns that will keep you guessing and reading. Does a good job of wrapping up one mystery and giving you enough of another one to keep reading the next book. Would recommend to those who enjoy paranormal romantic, mystery reading."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"My rating: 5 of 5 stars

This is Susanne O`learys latest book which I've had the greatest of pleasure in reading as an ARC.
Isn't the cover great!
I love this author as she's taken a different chance on this story, more intense and romantically raw in my opinion with things to hide that come out later as you read further on into the pages.

I liked this one as much as I loved her previous book Hot Property. This isn't a carry on from that, its a stand alone book in its own right.
Its taken me today to sit down and read this lovely enjoyable read.
Susanne never disappoints her readers, yet another thumbs up from me."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I don't know why I chose this book as the first book of Cole McCade to read but I am so glad that I did. This book is not for the faint of heart. It has strong elements of abuse and was very dark at times but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were times that it was hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So as you hear in so many instances of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger as the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she knows she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choices to not feel the pain that was inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel sees the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meets he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many elements of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he does this because he has experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of books because there are ALOT of references to books, both subtly and not but he weaves them into the story beautifully. Even his acknowledgements were touching. Cole is definitely an author I will be following and reading and could there possibly be another story in the Crow City, fingers crossed!!"
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Archangel Zach is a quick paranormal read that I found to be interesting and enjoyable.  The plot is solid and the writing is strong and descriptive.  The author has created an engaging world where there are human angels on earth with special powers as well as the Archangels from the Angelic Realm.  These are not supposed to mix in a relationship, but you know what happens when something's forbidden...

Zach's character is tormented and has never gotten past losing his love over three hundred years ago.  It is easy to empathize with him, and to understand why he keeps Shasa at arms length.  I did have a difficult time seeing the two of them together, for some reason they just did not click for me...I just didn't feel that spark between them, I'm not sure exactly why.

The story itself moves well, the second half quicker than the first mostly due to the action and drama that is occurring at that point.  I was able to read this in less than a day, and found the story easy to follow even though I haven't read anything else from this series yet.

If you're a fan of angel books, especially when they mix with humans, this is a good story for you.  Recommended for 18+ due to some language and adult sexual scenes."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"An extremely unprepossessing look at the author's youth, which was fairly off the beaten track, to put it mildly. The woman who wrote the forward said it well, you want to hug this guy who went thru so much crap from his own family. But man, can he tell a great story! Can't wait to read more; thank you, Sssssssstace."
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"So far, I have picked this up and put it down four times. Each time I picked it up, I had forgotten what I was reading. Just got to 24 percent of the way through, and this jarring inconsistency did it for me.  Chris tells the Secretary she doesn't drink, but several pages later, she's having a beer. Not sure if I can finish the book."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"3.5 torn stars, rounded up. I liked the story, but it was a cliffhanger, which I really don't like at all. When I invest hours of precious time in a story, get into it, and then discover I have to buy the next ""x"" number of books to find out what happens and get some closure, I'm not happy.

Besides that, I did like the story. I'm a big fan of paranormal romance, and this one was different enough from the usual to be fresh and interesting. After a slow start detailing the travels of the heroine, things really picked up when she finally found what she'd been looking for all along - a vampire. The characters were likable enough, though some plot lines seemed a little forced. Paranormal secondary characters were enjoyable, but I found the heroine's best friend to be pushy and kind of obnoxious.

I'm not sure if I'll grab the next one, knowing I'm setting myself up for another cliffhanger (did I mention I really don't like cliffhangers?). It will depend on if the story sticks with me in the next couple of weeks."
Kindle_Store_5,1,OR,Not for me.  Not a fan of this type of relationship. Could not finish.
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"a good book, interesting story, kept my interest.  nothing exceptional, just a good, solid read.  I would recommend this book"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I downloaded a free copy of this book from Story Cartel in exchange for my honest review.

I was surprised by this book. I thought I was going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I was pleasantly surprised!

Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of us do - we make a list of why things won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationships a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same.

Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keeps going back and forth between her first love and different guys before she makes up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what was wrong with the heroine.

Girl on a Hot Tin Roof was my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be! The story is about a young girl who has become a little more than overwhelmed by the male attention she's receiving from the construction workers across her street.

All in all, not a bad read, but would've preferred the last two stories to have a little more length.

I would recommend this book for persons looking for a light, witty, quick read."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I WANT PART 2 ASAP. KHYREE  CAYDEN  MEATS CARMEN D'WEL AND MO. MO MOMS IS  SO EVIL IN THIS BOOK. I WONDER WHO WAS SHOOTING AT THEM
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,He try to get back with Anna seem there are people try to keep them apart. It seem he is lying to her again a great book love it just wished James wasn't a jerk! Need to read this book it tell you how guy are jerk and players.
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This was my first Heidi Hutchinson book. I really enjoyed it and plan to read more of her work. The only issue that I really had was the characters age verses their maturity. I would've thought that they were in their late teens, early twenties at the oldest...but otherwise a good read."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"This is a quick, heated historical read about a young woman being pressured to marry the right man and a man with no title and no fortune who also happens to love her. Its short, sweet and has sexy moments, but there really isn't much more to it than that. Both characters have appeared briefly in the rest of the series and to be honest I didn't really learn much more about them in this book. Paul is quiet and honorable, Georgina feels trapped by the rules imposed on her and does her best to flout them where she can  which contradicts her previous behavior, where shes been much more prim and proper. If you're looking for a quick read with some Regency flair  including a fun historical outing to see Madame Tussaud's waxworks  and like a bit of sensual heat, then this will likely fit the bill. Certain things were resolved a little too easily for my liking, but that might have been thanks to the short length. Overall its a nice read that unites a couple of minor characters from the series. (I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I used to think that I'm reading fast and efficiently but after reading this book, I realized I have so much more to learn and I still have bad habits to remove. Reading this book helped me learn about various effective techniques in speed reading such as developing better comprehension, concentration, and perception; developing a better sense of urgency when reading; interpreting more words in less time; working around inner speech, vocalizations, and regression; and learning how to skim. I am now applying these techniques and I can definitely see better results when it comes to my reading."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"A short, well written read with a good plot and no cliff-hanger.  Although it is the 3rd in the series I found it easy to read as a standalone.  This book would appeal to those who enjoy paranormal Romance type stories.

I was gifted this book for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"There's so much more to Agora. Kingdoms in conflict, the future of the children and the hopes of parents, all set to the deepening of the characters we already fell in love with. Can't wait to read the next one. My only fear is I'll read them all and have to wait for the next to be published."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"This book is just silly fluff. An entertaining read, but I had to mock it as I was reading it. Props to the author for the creativity."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"While this book was written with children in mind, one simple tool ""validation"" amazingly works to instantly defuse a raging adult as well as a child in the throes of an escalating tantrum. The only trick is to remember to use the tool.

Well written, by an experienced parenting coach who offers other valuable insights for everyone who enjoys calm in their relationships, averting embarrassing scenes, and raising children who feel protected and loved. A must read."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is a cute short story. I liked the characters and for a short story, there was a nice flow to it.

Rebecca has problems with self-esteem. She doesn't see what everyone else see's in her, then throw in a verbally abusive boyfriend and she is pretty hard on herself.

After being dumped by her boyfriend on her birthday, in a very public way, Rebecca finally gains the confidence she was lacking. With the help of her pushy best friend Angela, Rebecca is in for a night that she will never forget."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"For Lacey the last couple years of her life has been full of upheaval. The loss of her mother when she needs her most has left her spiraling out of control. Her emotions are all over the place, her decisions are proving risking and the people she is supposed to be apple to count on have turned that back on her. In her mind she is on her own. Coop sees a kindred spirit in the tortured young woman with the bad attitude. He has been dealing with a number of crisis in his own life. Lacey brings out his protective instincts. Among other things. A lost of control, a surprise revelation and the differences in their ages are obstacles he can't ignore. Facing fears, coping with loss and growing up are all explored within this novel. I received an ARC of Some Girls Do by Amy Andrews in exchange for an honest review. What I took from this story is change whether good or bad is an inevitable learning experience."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I love the story.  I was waiting for a very dramatic ending. Like a matter of life ending but the one that was presented was also nice and funny.
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"My introduction to Sophia Henry and her Pilots series was through Power Play. Gaby and Landon had a meaty story but there was a disconnect for me. So I decided to try again with Interference. Ms. Henry is consistent in her willingness to tackle subjects that are painful. From the beginning she delivers that one, two punch. Complex people facing their demons and working to overcome them. Jason has baggage that has followed him into adulthood. From abandonment and trust issues, to an attraction that pulls the scab off a partially healed wound. Linden has worked to become a responsible young woman. An act of rebellion in her teens left her with more responsibility than she expected and the shame of disappointment. Interference redeemed Sophia Henry in my eyes. Sympathy, empathy and hope are the stepping stones to an amazing and inspirational story."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I have read all of this series so far pretty much the same but I so enjoy the reading them keep up the good work
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I enjoyed reading this book very much. There were a few twists and turns that made this book really stand out over the usual mail order bride books.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,A friend sent me this book thinking I needed the info!  It was really well written and answered all my questions.  I discovered eating and a sedentary lifestyle aren't the only things that can cause weight gain.  There was info on supplements that I wan't familiar with.  It took all the mystery out of heart monitors. I now have a better idea of how many calories I should be consuming.  And I found the section on muscle confusion really interesting.  This book is good motivation for weight loss!
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"(Source: I receieved a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to author Kris Kreisman.)
Erin is good at tennis, but while she likes it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it does to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just wants to have a normal life.

One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin finds herself sent back in time to 1970, where she has the chance to play tennis against her mother.
Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time?

This was an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places.

Erin liked tennis, but not as much as her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movies with her friends when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she was getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I was going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friends in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the prices were in the shops!

The storyline was okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she gets with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story.
The ending was okay, and it was good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's actions in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed things in the present.

Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story.
5 out of 10."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I learned a lot from this book.  There is a lot of information on how to structure your tweets and what kind of tweets.  I had never seen any one separate them in those categories before.  Keeping as a reference.  I'm now interested in his other books.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"What a journey!  I always love a happy ending, and I wasn't disappointed this time.  The path the characters take to get to the happy ending is full of mines and pitfalls that make a person wonder how anyone survives such things.  The author has built solid, wonderful characters, as true to life as they can be!  I would love to read more books by Christin."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I just love the sas and wit that the strong females bring to these books. I enjoyed this book just as much as the 1st, and am now going to read the third."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Trina M. Lee's books have a way of drawing you into the story. This one was no exception. It has action, a bit of romance, and even some mystery. I enjoyed this book and know you will too."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This was my first book by Ms Roberts and let me tell you it will not be my last! Wasn't sure I would like it, the hero is not your usual, but holy smokes..it is an amazing read!
Don't miss this one!!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Life is too short to read dull books. When one grabs me and holds on, satisfying to the taut conclusion, then I don't care about missing words or punctuation or whether the book needs another round with a proofreader. This one qualifies. Excellent horror elements within the sci fi, building to a foreseeable yet still gripping end. Nicely done, Mr Notch."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Billed as a link between the tv show and the game, this is an OK little information rag. Its got some nice pictures from the game."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Just a heads up, if you have read other timeless romance anthologies, then you may have read some of these stories before. Five of the six are found in other anthologies. Regardless, some of the stories are definitely worth another read.
I didn't particularly like the first story, Our Song Cassie was a bit too whinny for me, but that was more personal preference than a reflection on the story. War of Hearts also felt a little contrived, but I am sure there are those that would disagree.
I did enjoy Between the Lines. The romance was so cute and I couldn't help but root for Thomas to work out his mix up. I also loved William and his concern for Claire in A Taste of Home.   Both these stories had swoon worthy endings left you rooting for happily ever afters.
All in all a collection of great stories and definitely worth the read especially if you are new to Timeless Romance Anthologies."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I loved every part of this story. It was entertaining, creative, had a dry sense of humor that I very much appreciate, and had the perfect ending. I found myself chuckling more than once. Great great story. Mr. Fry is quickly moving to the top of my favorite indie author list."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Veiled by L. Chapman is a story about losing the one you love and finding someone when you least expect it. Jenny is put through more than one could imagine as she begins to feel her pending nuptials are in danger of panning out. Her fianc, Rich, has become withdrawn in their relationship. Feeling lost and in need of a girls night, she meets a handsome stranger in a bar. Warren turns out to be the spark she was missing in her life.

Much to Jenny's surprise, she finds her husband with another man. He is honest with her and explains the possibility of a health risk. The two are not on speaking terms thanks to this shocking revelation. After tests and full disclosure to Warren, they continue to get closer with their feelings. Knowing her whole world is changing right before her eyes, Jenny decides to move on the best she can and let things take their rightful course.

Veiled ends one happy ending and gives hope to finding a new one. The plot moves quickly as it seems a black cloud is following Jenny everywhere she goes. Her share of bad luck surely must be about to end soon. I was happy to see Mark and Megan were still going strong in their relationship. Baby Lucy is cherished and loved by her little family. Unfortunately, it was hinted that there would be upcoming turmoil with Lucy's custody. This book ends with another cliffhanger and we will have to wait to see exactly what pans out in the series."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,It ended very abruptly. I was really enjoying the book and then it just ends. So much was left unanswered and it was just disappointing. It built to this great ending but stopped short. I would have liked there to have been something more.
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"When I read third and final book in this series, I almost cried!
Then I read the book. I'm still disappointed it's over.  But I love this series!!

Blake made it home to S-Island in book 2 #Fight. Alexis and Zach were together and things
were odd.
But Alexis proposed a solution; they just be together. Black, Zach, and Alexis.
Could the men do it? Could Alexis?

Before anything can happen, crazy Claire decided she was tired of Alexis getting in her way and tries to take her out. In the process both women find their way to a biker camp.
Women are traded for goods. Alexis is kept with the KingPin who is useless.
She comes up with a plan to rescue herself and any other women willing to escape with her.
Blake and Zach are planning too. They need to get their girl back.
Can they do it before she is killed or hurt?

This is another fast paced book, that keeps you on your toes and thinking.
What's going to happen? Can this work?"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had to laugh at the antics of the main character, Aiden, to woo Katie over. He was relentless in getting her to admit that she loved him and wanted to be with him. But through it all he knew Katie better than she knew herself it seemed. He was caring and did things to help her and she didn't know, she just thought he was being annoying and pestering her. I think Katie secretly enjoyed the back and forth that took place between herself and Aiden.

I liked how the book weaved some of the history of the Cheyenne into the story. It showed the struggles that were faced back in the day and how you cant judge someone by first appearances. You never know what secret that might have and it could surprise you. I thought the book was well written and seemed to be one of the better books so far in the series.

Overall I enjoyed this book and cant wait to read the next one in the series to see how the other characters fared."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This is the second book in Barbour's holiday series. Well-written plot with realistic characters that has no real connection to the Christmas holiday other than the setting. Deputy Shawna Mallory is a thirty-one year old single cop who lives in the rather sleepy town of Carlton Grove. She has a deep commitment to her job, and moves quickly when she hears an amber alert on the radio for a missing eleven year old boy. Mallory hears a dog barking; she finds the boy under a snow drift being guarded by the pup. The sheriff agrees to take the boy in while he awaits a new foster care family.

Complications arise when the boy's real father arrives back on the scene from an overseas assignment in Chile. John Reid McCrae appears to have a poor parenting track record, but Shawna's friend Alice knew him many years ago and offers a different opinion. In the meantime Shawna grows attached to Billy, who is about to be given to a new foster family. Billy runs away once again, but even more puzzling is the strange affect Billy's dad has upon Shawna. What outcome ensues for Billy, John, and the Deputy Sheriff whose lives have become entangled.

A heartwarming story revolving around coming of age, domestic violence, foster care, romance, pets and peer relationships that will tear at the heart strings of young adult and adult readers. Actually, the book could be a middle grade read if one is willing to look past a few curse words and one or two light romantic scenes. Snow Pup is the kind of story that will put the reader in the mood for the holiday season."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"The concept of ""Twisted"" intrigued me, and I'm very glad that I gave it a try.  I really enjoyed reading the story of Gianna and Hunter, and I really loved the supernatural elements woven into the story in believable ways.  There were a few parts of the story where I had to suspend disbelief in other ways (for instance, the way the principal divulged medical information about a staffer sort of threw me), and there were a few grammatical things that caught my eye, but these things were minor and didn't detract from my ability to enjoy the story.  Good work, Ms. Phillips, and I eagerly anticipate the sequel!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"We received a early copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.

Talon and Gretchen's book was a wonderful read. The characters are well thought out and all blend together to form a great story. I didn't read the first book in this series but it definitely wasn't necessary to this story. Gretchen travels back to her hometown to try to figure out what has happened with her father. While there, she meets Talon and the sparks fly from there. I would recommend this book to those that like reading a paranormal/shifter type series with familiar characters but who also like books that you don't have to necessarily read in order. I will definitely be looking for future books from this author.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"RC kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review. Taming Alaska was amazing!! It was a thrilling page-turner with well-developed, witty characters. Cyn was one of the best female leads I've read. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, went after her dreams (even if they were bad for her), and held her own in the Alaskan wilderness. There were times where the situation was gravely serious and she would have these thoughts that made you wonder about her depth, but then you realized that if you were in her situation you'd probably want to check some things off your bucket list too. Shane was perfect. He kept Cyn safe in some pretty harsh conditions, he was able to make light of a bad situation, while also being serious when he needed to be. Cyn and Shane together were everything. They just worked. But their story isn't finished yet. I can only assume there will be a sequel. And I. Cannot."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Argh, this book is very frustrating. It's sort of like reading a stream of consciousness with, lots of quick random changes of topic. Sort of like giving a character an accent it's sorta interesting, but it got old quickly.

It's also a thriller, and it uses a bunch of cheap tricks to achieve that. Every other page is some new dangerous life or death situation. Despite all the talk of how competent the characters are they are still thrown from one random situation to another, really they are just along for the ride their choices don't seem to matter, the author will dues ex machina as needed to keep people alive and to keep the suspense and urgency going. Also he's really light on the backstory, constantly hinting at it with characters literally saying ""ill explain everything later"" but they never do.

Frustratingly I think the setting of the book is fairly interesting, sort of a shadow run setting, except more post apocalyptic and heavier on the brain hacking/AI side. Unfortunately it being the sort of thriller it is , it doesn't really build a coherent world, you're just left with a bunch of impressions with no predictive power."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is a gift from the author, so people can see what her style is like.  Clean romance, and realistic characters.  There is a sweetness about the story and the writing.

Sweet romance is probably a better term for the writer's style.  She has an eye for detail that brings the people to life.  And she has an eye for attraction so she can communicate it in suble ways.

In this day and age of porn, filth, debasing fiction, this writer is a relief and a reassurance that goodness still lives in the world.  I've read some of her other books, novels, and they are just as clean, lovely and romantic."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This book is so, so good.  I wish I had known about this series before, but I will definitely being going back to catch up on all the books I have missed.

This book starts off with Vaughn in the hospital, hell bent on finding Lark, who has stolen something that is very precious to him.  It is immediately apparant that these two have a history (which may have been revealed in the other books that I haven't read yet).  Once Vaughn is healed he sets out to find the elusive woman that stole not only property from him, but his heart as well.

Lark is on the run from her past.  No one knows who she truly is and she can't let anyone ever find out or else she is a dead woman.  Running has recently become harder after he last stop.  Not only did she make some really good friends but she went and fell in love as well.  That is how she knew it was time to move on, she promised never to let herself get too attached to anyone ever again.

With the help of his brother and a few close friends Vaughn is able to track lark down.  However, things aren't exactly as they appear and once he finds out who Lark really is there is nothing he won't do to protect the woman he loves and bring her back home where she belongs.

I received an eARC of this book compliments of the publisher in exchange for my honest review and opinon.  All ratings and opinions stated are my own."

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I saw this movie a long time ago. I loved it. I bought it because it is funny. The price was cheap
Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"This was almost unwatchable.  My question?  Did Jeremy Renner need the money?
I really don't have much else to say about this movie.  There were 2 times the F word was used and for no real reason.  It was rather a gratuitous use of the word.  J. Renner said it once and it was seemed so ridiculous.  The names Hansel and Gretel also seemed ridiculous as well in this movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,reminded you of old west and details excellent to make it authentic looking.
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"I might have known it was too puerile for my taste, although a number of sophisticated adults loved it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,This is better than the remake.  Glenn Ford is one of my favorite western actors

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I read all the Dean Koontz books he puts out, He's a great story teller and always look for movies made from his books.  This is a good one.  Hoping for more of the series."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I ordered the season and watched every episode back to back as soon as it became available. Epic! This season parts company from the books because there are no more novels at present, so purists will find a lot to dislike about this season. On the other hand, it is great TV with some fantastic acting by all of the male leads. Kit Harrington, Liam Cunningham and Stephen Dillane are powerful all the way through, and Tyrion and Sir Jorah are a delight as always. Great work from Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow.
As for the women, Arya and Brienne continue to surprise and delight, and Sansa gets a bit less like a wet noodle.  Circe is up to her usual tricks but as Bronn says, evil has a tendency to turn back on itself. Margery and her gran, the amazing Diana Rigg, rounded things out pretty nicely. Not much movement from Queen Dany but we are left with all sorts of interesting possibilities in the final episode.
There are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of Episode 10 and throughout the whole season with respect to Bran, and for the past 2 seasons with regard to Rickon and the wilding woman who was supposed to find somewhere safe for him. Episode 8 shows there is nowhere safe from the Whitewalkers.  Great special effects and settings round off an excellent season, not perfect, but certainly better than most things on TV these days. With any luck, there will be many more seasons to come."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"It's interesting seeing him do stand up as opposed to his weekly program, and observing the audience reaction to his politically incorrect ideas - which is what I like best about him as a comedian and political commentator.  This recording is a few years old, so it's interesting to revisit older material in light of current events.  Maher keeps getting better."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,Not as good as Overboard. But it will provide the entire family with some belly laughs.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"We sometimes equate God's love as answering our prayers, but God has an ultimate plan for our lives. He uses each and everyone of us, to fulfill His plan. Even in death...we can have a profound impact on the people around us who are still left on earth. Our time here on earth is so short, but an eternity with God is forever. Great movie and I love they didn't sugarcoat the truth! :)"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I remember seeing this film so long ago, and the story always fascinated me. Yeah it's an old black and white, but that's what makes it so classic. Myself, I prefer the black and white films as they were released. Colorizing them just takes away the focus you have on the movie. But, I am going to purchase, I think, two more versions. Like I said before, I really like the concept of this film."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This is about a man whose son is a world traveler that is on his way down the Camino de Santiago when he falls to his death.  His father completes his journey.  It changes his life.  It's about the hardships and people he meets along the way.  Starring real life father and son, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez.  Wonderful scenery and story."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,this has to be one of the best Bond films in the top 5. I have seen all 007 movies an own them all on dvd. Watched Skyfall 3 times in the first couple of days. Daniel Craig is one of the top 3 Bonds. Sean Connery is number 1 Peirce Bronson number 2. I guess it is who you grew up with. ( Tom Baker is the best Dr.
Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"Buy the Region 2 DVD (released by Fabulous Films in 2008) from amazon UK. It's widescreen (*not* pan & scan), plus it comes with a Director's Commentary which offers good insights from Joseph Sargent (who also directed the original ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"").

Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.

*********************
UPDATE November 2009
Looks like this has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Wonder if that means a proper Region 1 release (widescreen) might be in the works? Maybe a 40th Anniversary Edition next year??"
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Good movie, but you need to understand the story prior to watch it."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This film reminds me of MTV's biorhythm.

I can't say i was deeply touched but it was a good film. I'm glad i saw it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Cate is the iconic Elizabeth.  No one has done this historical figure any better as far as I can see.  Highly entertaining.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This was purchased as a gift, meaning that someone else (not me) has watched it.  The response that I recieved was great however, so this gets good marks."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"If you like the stars, you'll probably like this romantic comedy.  It follows a typical--though not entirely predictable--formula, but both stars are delightful throughout."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Strangers With Candy is a perfect send-up of insipid topical  teen shows like My So-Called Life and the After School Specials that spewed conformist propoganda into the ears and eyes of America's youth every weekday afternoon during the 1980's.  I remember watching it back when I had cable, as well as a slew of other top-notch shows that were on Comedy Central at the time (Upright Citizens Brigade, The Daily Show, South Park, T.V. Funhouse etc...).  Strangers With Candy may not have been the best of these shows, or even the edgiest, but it very well may have been the darkest.  South Park and T.V. Funhouse were/are certainly caustic and dark, but 'Strangers' was pitch black.  This humor is truly without reverence.  Nothing is sacred, all is petty, and the mere concept of morality itself becomes the joke.

Comedy Central is truly a great network.  Whenever possible, complete creative freedom is given to (gasp!) the CREATORS of the show.  Strangers With Candy certainly benefitted from this policy; its vision is clearly uncompromised.  Every aspect of the production contributes to a consistent representation of a unified concept.

I recently rented the first and second seasons and the latter is the better of the two.  I am looking forward to renting the third season.  If you are a fan of black comedy, Strangers With Candy will tickle your funny bone - and then break it."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"Delivery Man... cute idea, ok script, still yet another Vince Vaughn movie,  If you like his acting is worth watching ONCE...  Predictable Hollywood box office hail mary pass"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"You get a mix of action, drama, suspense, etc.  If you've seen the anime, there's nothing I can think of that would surprise you.  Keep an eye on the price, I purchased this when it lowered from the $100s down to about $44.  The only complaint that I have is that the menu screen is a little hard to see because of the aqua background with white wording."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Great remake! It took me a couple of watches, but I loved the story and cinematography."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"High Noon is one of my husband's all time favorites. It's got some terrific lines in it. He's always quoting one of them. I bought this for his 71st birthday and he watches it at least twice a month. We like the fact that in the day and time this movie was made, foul language was unacceptable! Oh, that this was true today! It's a ""must see"" movie and worth every penny to buy it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"One of my serious all-time favorite movies. Good every couple years. LOVE Jeff Bridges, and the goofy humor, makes me laugh every time."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Fat Head does what Super Size Me failed to do; it entertained its audience, yes, but not at the expense of getting out its message. And the message is clear: we've been duped and had the wool pulled over our eyes for too long concerning nutrition in America. I was already familiar with the material prior to viewing this movie as I have read many, many books on the topic, but Naughton uses fabulous visuals that help to elucidate the finer points and clarify some of the muddier issues. Make no mistake, Tom Naughton is super smart as well as funny, and he has solicited the help of some of the best minds in the field of nutrition and medicine to show the public where Morgan Spurlock went horribly wrong in his conclusions. A must see film, and one that should be distributed to every library in the nation. I recommend it highly. Good Calories, Bad Calories(book) by Gary Taubes is a great companion piece to the film as it presents a lot of the scientific data that the film uses to make its points."
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,I'm a huge movie fanatic.  I've seen just about anything and everything.  I was so excited for this movie to come out because it's difficult to find a good horror movie that's not ridiculous these days.  Not only could I not follow this one nor did it hold my interest at all....but the plot was just poor.  I'm sure they were trying for something different here but I think it could have been better.  I wanted to give it one star but gave them an extra one for effort only.
Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,We found a cut place on one of the dvd watching it . It totally stop working. A one star rating they don't deserve even that.
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

Guide: F-bomb. Nudity."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Although Daniel Craig isn't my favorite Bond, this movie is well worth watching. Strong script, good acting, and excellent action make for an enjoyable 2hr 24min film.

My favorite part is the blast from the past in the last quarter of the movie... No spoilers here, but you'll know it when you see it!

Great way to spend an evening!

Highly recommended..."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Welcome to the world of Johnny Quid: London in flux between the old school fixers, new school Russian money, and petty thieves in between. Guy Ritchie takes you on a wild ride through the madness and mayhem that begins with the a shady real estate deal and never lets up. This perfectly paced piece of action adventure stars some great actors, including Tom Wilkinson who delivers an awesome performance. Everyone does a great job as they pursue their individual goals through a landscape studded with bizarre, yet linked incidents. Some of it is contrived, but all good movies are. Sit back, enjoy the ride and watch this movie at least three times to catch all the subtlety. Guy Ritchie is a brilliant director. I only wish he would make more movies."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Best of the X-men series by far.  I wish Matthew Vaughn had directed the first 3 of them too.  Almost enough to make up for the crapfest that was Brett Ratner's X-Men Last Stand.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I love westerns ..  Good entertainment . great movies  . She likes lonesome Dove so I thought  keep it going  .  We both loved it . highly recommend..
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Really great movie. Burton is at his best and the rest of the actors are as well. A well-measured approach to a perceived real world look at what being a spy must be like- true to form. Not much James Bond like action here but that isn't what this movie is all about. This is a character study that almost feels like a stage play: every scene is set and paced to take the viewer deeper and deeper into this hidden and bleak world.

  Viewing this film over Amazon prime was a treat. Although in B&W, it was very sharp and very close to true Blu-ray image quality. Of course with any movie enhanced by the Blu-ray process there is always something one never noticed before that catches the eye. In this case I couldn't help but be distracted by the small growth under Burtons right eye. It was distracting because I've never seen it before in his other films. But I guess every diamond has its flaw and IMO that was this the only thing I found about this film that I didn't like."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Wonderful setting to enjoy while you practice with Rodney.  He is a concise teacher that has really helped get my back in better shape.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"O.k so people your right this one doesn't measure up to other Disney animated classics like ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"", but then again maybe that is not such a bad thing.  Anyone remember the little disaster in-a-box from 1996 ""Humpback?"" No well then count yourself blessed and spared by the divine hand of God  It was bad.
This movie was not bad, not at all in fact I rather enjoyed it.  The storyline was solid if not wholly original and the graphics were great, sorta reminded me of Titan A.E only this movie got me to laugh once in a while whereas Titan A.E didn't.  The voice actors also seemed to have a fun time with what they were doing.
The thing that killed this movie and why it so poorly at the box office was just the shear number of Treasure Island movies out there.  I'm sure that if this move had been a wholly orginal idea it would have been a box office smash, but unfortunately it was not.
If you have the opportunity to but this one go ahead and do it.  This movie will surly keep both you and the kids interested.  On the plus side for adults the annoying singing is kept to a minimum"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"These two movies give Johnny Depp a great opportunity to show his acting range, and he doesn't disappoint.

""Sleepy Hollow"" is perhaps the definitive film version of this well-known tale, though it is not for the faint-of-heart. It gets pretty gory, what with the Headless Horseman out and about his business. We tend to watch this film around Halloween...then see if we can get over its ghastly images by Xmas.

I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway with Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and Victor Garber many years ago. Cariou and Lansbury were spectacular. Garber, not so much - Sondheim's music for the male ingenue role is pretty ungracious, and neither Garber nor Jamie Campbell Bower in this film version has any success negotiating the vocal writing.

Depp's film Sweeney is a great deal more-frightening and disturbed than what I saw on B'way. That's possible in large part because he doesn't have to project his singing voice and stage persona into a live theatrical space (truth is Depp's singing voice wouldn't project well into the open space of a typical B'way theater without major amplification). That makes for a more-intimate, more-human portrayal, and it's fairly disturbing. The rest of the cast is good as well.

Both films were directed by Tim Burton who seems to get the best out of Depp. The ""By The Sea"" sequence in Sweeney is particularly touching in fleshing out the human sides of Todd and Mrs Lovett that might have been in a way that just isn't possible in the staged version.

If you want to enjoy Sweeney as a disturbed horror flick, get this version. If your main interest is hearing the music, get the 1982 ""Tribute"" version with Lansbury and George Hearn.

Recommended (the price is certainly right - I paid only $10.86 with tax for both movies!), but not for the squeamish."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I am glad I bought this movie.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  Glad to add it to my movie collection.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Who doesn't need the Rocky triligy for their dvd library?
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.

Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.

Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.

The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.

The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,A unique view how kids view the adult working world.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"For me, this movie captures all the magic and imagination of Walt Disney in a way few others ever have. I own this DVD myself and bought it for my daughter and my grandchildren. This movie is a true classic that I think never has received the acclaim it is due."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I have to say that this was a very powerful movie that tells the truth of how addiction can take the life and talent of a young man and turn it upside down. A must see.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I actually did not know that Rodan was a color film since it was that long ago since I've seen it. Loved watching these classic Kaiju movies.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"For those of you who enjoy Farscape, this season was very well thought out, planned, and executed.  Each episode keeps you wanting to see the next one, not because they end them with a cliff hanger, but rather because the story is so well told.
Follow the story of Commander Chrichton, a human who was shot through a worm hole to a distant part of the galaxy and meet both old and new characters, as well as say farewell to a couple that we've known and enjoyed watching in this series.
Personally one my my absolute all time favorite series ever!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"If you like The Hobbit films, you owe it to yourself to get the Extended Edition.  Even though Steve Jackson did not give us as much extra material in the Hobbit films as he did in the Extended LOTR, the Extended Battle of Five Armies has substantially more material than the theatrical edition.  It also ties up some loose ends that exist in the theatrical film.  For people who like short, simple films, this entire series is too long.  For people who love Tolkien, and understand why a film cannot be the same as a book, it is too short.  Recommended."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Really liked this series due to it not taking itself too seriously! Characters are consistent throughout series. I will view future episodes if any.
Quality of video is awesome too! Again, thanks Amazon!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"My son actually wore out his videotape copies of Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase, Zombie Island, and Witch's Ghost. That's how much of a Scooby fan he is and has been since he was first introduced (he's 10 now).

This is actually a much better movie than some of the latest efforts (e.g. AbracadabraDoo) in my son's opinion. It was scarier (I think Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are scary too and he agrees) and less ""campy"" then some of the others we've watched lately. He was mesmerized by it from the moment it arrived - and has watched it several times. I thought the music was good and the voice acting decent enough. A bonus episode from the TV series is included which my son enjoyed as well.

In the end we'll collect this one just like the others. We have a whole shelf of Scooby movies and shows. Since this one has already been watched a couple times it's definitely going up on that keeper shelf!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,THE BEGINING AGE OF MOTION PICTUES-THIS TIME  IN CHINA. ESSENTIAL TO FILM LOVERS.
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"The idea, conceived by producer J. J. Abrams, is brilliant, and the story told here is exciting, riveting stuff. It's tense and, at times, genuinely scary. If not for one little problem, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film. The problem is in the presentation. Since the entire movie is supposed to come from a single hand-held camera, everything is in Shaky-Cam (or, as Roger Ebert aptly called it, ""Queasy-Cam""). Hence, the movie quickly and continually induces vertigo in its audience; of the six members of my party, four reported some degree of motion sickness. Somewhere further down in the theater, we heard at least one person vomit. No matter how good a movie is -- and this one is, in its way, very very good -- it suffers when you can't bear to look at the screen. It's hard to appreciate the filmmaker's craft when you're trying to keep down the buffalo chicken sandwich you foolishly ate on the way to the theater. by Tom Knapp, Rambles."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Fun, intelligent, fascinating historical drama. In a class by itself in a world of ""so much the same"" contemporary crime dramas!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"If you are interested in getting a feeling for the awful events that plagued Rwanda during the genocide acts recently - this is a great presentation of the events, based on my knowledge. It is kind of documentary and drama blended together.

What is striking, given the date of this review, is just how ludicrous the world can be. It is shameful! People knew the events were taking place but with no oil or resources for nations to maul there was no interest to lend a hand. There are no acts of humanitarianism by super powers, just self fulfilling acts that benefit leaders of nations - self interest. Take the wikileaks for example that are surfacing today. The ""problem"" is the leaks? How can that be? The leaks are documents of criminal acts by leaders of governments - so why is the site questioned and not the leaders?

If you want to get a sense of international mismanagement - I feel we have the responsibility to do so, please watch this video. Other sources on the topic would include Darfur now, and The History and Sociology of Genocide (see below).

This video is a great entertaining presentation of an event we should not have to document.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This is an intriguing documentary. It doesn't defend the practice of bestiality, but instead makes viewers acknowledge that zoophiles are utterly human, not evil or sinister. This is a story about a group of friends with a disturbing fetish (perhaps even a distinct sexuality, since they don't seem very interested in other humans). When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.

There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.

I recommend this film to anyone who is fascinated by sexuality or who seeks to understand outsiders."

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I have not read the book so this review is just based on this version of the story.  I loved it.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I really liked it. Well done, great story(s), great sound track. I'd watch it again."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I loved the action and plot and I loved the interaction between characters. Plenty of blowing up and plenty of revenge.
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"Family-oriented comedy ""Zoom"" has the right cast. Tim Allen is a retired, washed-up ex-superhero who is given a mission to train a group of misfit kids with special ability. The trainees are played by Spencer Breslin, Kate Mara, Michael Cassidy and Ryan Newman. The film also has decent production designs, and is supported by the veterans like Rip Torn and Chevy Chase. So far, everything is great. Well, it might not be great exactly, but you can at least expect a decent family picture like ""Sky High.""

However, the film is helmed by a wrong director, Peter Hewitt, whose previous works include first ""Garfield"" movie and ""Thunderpants"" (just in case you haven't seen it, the latter is a one-joke film about a farting boy). For all the charms and the talent of the cast, and the characters' likable nature, those would-be superheroes/heroines becoming transparent or making the body and limbs bigger like rubber ball, have already been done in ""The Incredibles"" or other films of the same genre. With some wit or twists added, those characters would have been more interesting. As it is, they remain just OK with the lazy direction and very familiar sight gags.

The film's weak script, which does not explain convincingly why these kids must be brought together and trained like this, is already a problem. But the saddest thing is, for me, watching Chevy Chase covered with greenish sticky slime coming out of a boy's nose. It's a worse kind of gag than pie-throwing.

I like Tim Allen, but it makes me sad to see his recent films like this and ""The Shaggy Dog."" The film is not as bad as the very low user rating of IMDb suggests and the father-daughter-like relations between him and Ryan Newman is credible, but except that (and cute Ryan Newman) I cannot think of the reason why this film had to be made."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"It's a good moive, I can't say great but good. It's not really a shoot em' up and bloody ol' war movie. It's really funny, none the less. Three guys, go out to get some money. That's all, untill they run into something that makes them think. It's a funny  movie, did I just say that? Yup! But that's it, so if your looking for something funny, and a little action, along with it, then check this movie out. Even for drama, cause it's got a few of that."

Still, it IS funny!

If you're not already a fan, try it. It may be your type of comedy. The Reno 911 gang of misfits always get into trouble and always find something inappropriate to do."
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"Not a very good copy, not a very good movie"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,are there any plans for other volumes in blu ray ? thay have another volume fan fav but just on dvd
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This is one of my all time favorite Godzilla movie, it has Godzilla teaming upi with Jet Jaguar a robot against Megalon and Gigan..."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Here's a film where Seagal doesn't just go through those regular paces we all love him for, which is probably why most of the viewers reviewing this film here are disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal plays a doctor who cares more about helping his patients get well than he does getting paid, not just because he gives both the government officials and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American traditions and healing methods play in this film.

Maybe for all those things.  Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it adds a dimension to his character that makes this more than just an action movie.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of enemies to defeat here, and Seagal defeats them all -- including the 'invisible enemy' of biochemical disease.  Not bad, not bad at all.  Better than good in fact.

Five stars."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"OK, Oscar material this isn't.  But hey, it's a talking dog movie what are you expecting, De Niro?  The plot is tissue paper thin and the acting is cheesy, but it is a talking dog movie.  My 95 yo mother thinks the idea of talking animal is hilarious, so good stuff."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This is the only sequel to place the central figure, Prof. Horatio Smith(Leslie Howard), (Scarlet Pimpernel re-incarnate) a century and then some years in the future. Yet, knowing this, this meticulously restored yarn stands entirely alone in thought-provoking suspense, cat-and-mouse deception and thought. Cambridge Prof. Smith is traveling through Germany in wartime with a handful of students while a mysterious man rescues endangered scientists, intellectuals. Are they connected and how? The way Leslie Howard embodies this earlier Indiana Jones archaeologist so completely with all the thrills of his original Scarlet Pimpernel (disguises/surprises) yet takes on fully the seriousness of the Nazi threat to humanity with witty and thought-provoking dialogue places this above most WWII yarns. Added to the Gestapo pressures is an added tension of a cagey female (Mary Morris) pursuer seeking the identity of this war-time savior. The polished script by Leslie Howard is fantastically photographed making this a compelling lustrous addition to the WWII spy genre. A final monologue directed to the Gestapo is as valid today as it was in the 40s."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,this was a gift for my sister which she loves. would recommend it to everyone who is willing to buy.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,I LIKED THIS MOVIE ITS A WESTEREN TO THE FULLEST AND BALE IS JUST AWESOME THIS IS A PURCHASABLE MOVIE DVD!!
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I really can't suggest anything that would make this film better.  The acting is top notch, not just from DeNiro and Grodin, but from the entire cast.  Each character is well defined and believable. I especially liked Dennis Farina's parody of the tough-talking Mafia boss (""Shut up or I'll shove this pencil through your heart!""), and his two flunkies (Moron #1 and Moron #2). The dialogue is great, and the film is laced with humor--the best kind of humor, situational.  There is even a tender awkward moment (when Jack, DeNiro, visits his daughter whom he hasn't seen in years, and she offers to give him her babysitting money, which he feels he shouldn't take, although he needs it).  The action is non-stop, and if you have to suspend your disbelief at times, it is a small price to pay.

The evolution of the relationship between DeNiro and Grodin's characters, as has been mentioned, is the core of this picture. It is done magnificently and is the reason the film is so great. There are so many great scenes: when DeNiro and Grodin are eating dinner on the train, when they pretend to be from the Treasury Department in order to relieve a bartender of his ""counterfeit"" 20 dollar bills, the scene in the diner when Grodin, really hungry and broke, asks what's the special today, and the waitress says chorizo and eggs (dig the look on Grodin's face). DeNiro says they can't afford it, and Grodin counters ""How about your cigarettes?"", and DeNiro says, ""I need these.""  The film is chock full of these delicious scenes--I really can't think of a dull one.

This film is forever.  Buy it and see for yourself."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,good family series.  with they had made more episodes
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,Sometimes it is hard to get into a different reality.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Jeanette MacDonald shines like a bright Northern star in this 1933 MGM classic also starring Ramon Novarro. Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.

Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously. I thought MacDonald and Novarro made lovely couple and the story is full of warmth."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This film is cute. This is more like a Disney Princess animated movie than a Hindi film. The singing and dancing is not ""Bollywood"", but it is a good movie.
Several members of our family love Pride and Prejudice (and all things Jane Austen) and we all enjoy Bollywood movies, too - so  this movie was a perfect family hit! Aishwarya Rai is fabulous and so is  Anupam Kher. The lines are memorable, and make this an oft quoted movie in our home. It's hard to find here in the U.S, at a reasonable price, so jump on this one when the price goes down. It's one worth watching over and over again."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,A very good moive on the live of African cats. The blu-ray one is the best well worth the price.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Grew up watching this series and now I own the entire series.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"it was very funny to watch and really entertaining, it kept me on laughing from begining to the end of the movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Excellent story based in England during WWII that runs the gamete of emotions. It deals with a young girl and her life. I enjoyed watching it and I could watch it again.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,All four Alien movies in one package loaded with bonus materials to keep fans of the series well informed and entertained.  I enjoyed the extended versions as well as the original theatrical releases.  Ripley remains one of the best screen heroines ever to strap on a flame-thrower or battle a Xenomorph Queen in an exo-frame Loader...
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Critics are generally not very nice to movies like this one.  I guess THEY didn't grow up watching this kind of stuff and don't  have those fond memories (which explains the 4 stars).  The night me and my family got cable tv in the early 80s (first ones in the neighborhood) this hilarious flick was on.  Nudity on the boob tube was still something new to us.  So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.  Plus, anything with Scatman Crothers (The Shining, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Twilight Zone: The Movie) is worth seeing.  This could be the 1982 equivalent of movies like American Pie.  Just leave your brain at the door, pop this in the machine and you'll find much to enjoy on a lazy saturday afternoon.  Try a triple feature with Sixteen Candles and Just One of The Guys (or Weird Science and The Breakfast Club).
NOTES:  The sign outside the music store says ""8 Tracks"".  I feel so OLD!!  Speaking of, there are at least 2 terrific songs on the soundtrack, ""Got to believe in Magic"", ""King and Queen of Hearts"", etc.  Worth the price alone."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,This classic monster movie spoof has all the cliches & bad dialog that I adored in the 1950s-60s science fiction horror movies.
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"As many other reviewers have noted, Rio Lobo is not one of John Wayne's better western tales. Overall, it is pretty entertaining, but there is not much new to offer. In fact, the Duke kind of seems over the hill in this one.

The plot is pretty simple to follow, and there are some pretty good gun fights. But, the acting is pretty lacking. Therefore, I do not recommend watching this movie, unless you are a pretty big John Wayne fan. If not, check out some of his earlier Westerns."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I don't really see giving this less than 4 or 5 stars.  The story
is powerful.  The message of 'by hurting yourself you also hurt
others in your life,' is presented well.  If you're interested in
a movie that gives you something to think about, it's worth the time."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"His favorite movie, done up in a beautiful Voight-Kampff case... he should write this review because I will get all the good things wrong.  He loves it to death and can't stop going over the pieces, even years after I bought it for him."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Truly enjoyed Season 1 and found Season 2 as enjoyable. Same timeframe as Downtown Abby just a different class of people.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Loved it,  I had never gotten to watch all of the shows in the correct sequence, so it was really nice to watch them all in the right sequence and how the story line thru many made a lot more sense.  LOL .  Didn't realize what I had really missed in some cases.  I think the series ended too soon, and would love to see 8 more yrs of the series.  Plan to watch this one all the way thru several times,  it never gets old to me.  Great series and the added special info is really good to watch. ... and gives you more insight."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"The Good Things
*Great photography style and quality.  Every scene is fascinating.
*Interesting group of characters, with lots of interesting and memorable moments.
*Good dialogue (and good monologues).
*Very interesting, broad view of the issue of drug addiction.  It accurately captures the good and evil of it.  It is a little thought-provoking.
*Has some funny parts and some sad dramatic parts.
*Excellent soundtrack.

The Bad Things
*A couple of really gross scenes (one involving the worst toilet in Scottland, and the other involving flying feces).
*Accents are intense, almost unbelievably so.
*Some extremely wierd parts.
*Pretty wierd plot.

Stylish and hip, this film is never dull.  It is filled with memorable scenes and dialogue.  The characters are mesmerizing.  At its core, this film approaches the issue of drug addiction objectively, revealing both the good and the bad that it perpetuates.  Altogether, it's a very interesting portrayal.  Anybody who is interested in this kind of material should check this out."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I loved this. It was so well done in black and white, with just the right amount of humor. The settings and costumes were so great."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Love this for under the litter box! Makes cleaning a little easier
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Good and sturdy.  Guinea's don't knock them over - easy to clean.  Will break easily if not super careful in the sink.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Worked great, only issue is a close friend borrowed and kept it.  Buying 2 more, one for my yorkie and one for my deer-chiweenie.  Both like to bark, this will stop them.  Currently have to block the doggie door as they will run out barking at the wind, a bird, nothing, everything.  Neighbors complain.  Since I have to work, this is not an ideal situation.  I put the collar on during the hours I work, and off when not working, it was great.  I plan on putting the collar on during the hours I work and then again a couple hours later turned off.  I want them to not bark and not associate it with the collar."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,I have used this twice and so far so good!
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"My dog likes it and she's elderly.  I don't know that it actually makes a difference in her joints, she is a 3 legged friend and I'm trying to prevent any further discomfort or issues."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Amazing! I love it, and my guinea pig loves it. Only, it was sent to me with a broken ramp. I had to contact Super Pet."
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"Muzzle is made of nylon and completely washable. Adjustable with minimal buckles. Description says that it will help prevent biting, barking, and chewing while allowing panting and drinking. My dachshund figured out how to bark with it on. So, if you're wanting it for the non barking feature, I wouldnt count on it. However, it would combat biting and chewing."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,my older dog needs these & likes them. i mix 2 in her food every night. she is a 13 year old beagle.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,I use as a topping for their regular food as they love a little variety.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"So, at first I hated this thing. I purchased this for my Oceanic Biocube 29 HQI and I couldn't find a good place for it. I tried the display portion, but the Aqualifter wasn't powerful enough to fill the level correctly within 0 minutes, and the water level had to change at least two centimeters before it would even kick on. I felt it was useless. Then, I relocated the sensor into the 3rd chamber. With my Tunze 9001, it's really tight in the last chamber, but it does fit and it works flawlessly. The water level is topped off about twice a day now and my salinity is stuck perfectly at 35 ppt. I've had no errors with it and I like the many 'safety' features that the controller includes.

This is a good buy for those who want a low-profile level sensor with built-in redundancies to prevent malfunction."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Just purchased this cat tree a week ago. It arrived quickly and was better than I imagined. The cat houses were large enough for my adult cats. I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

When I purchased this cat tree I saw that there were similar trees for less money, but I chose this one by Armarkat because the reviews said it was sturdy. I must admit this cat tree was easy to put together and it is extremely sturdy. My cats jump on and off and climb it without any wobbling. I have two cats and both are about 13 lbs. The carpet material is a little on the cheapy side, but the cats enjoy it so I can't complain. I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cats are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground. I purchased the 74"" tree and was concerned it might not be tall enough to make the cats feel secure, but it's plenty tall and spacious too!

If you are looking for a sturdy tree that your cat/s will enjoy I recommend this product by Armarkat."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I've used these over the past several years, so have a lot of experience with them.  I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.  I literally (""litter-ally""!) don't know if I could've survived having cats without these and the Litter Genie!  Next step - toilet-training the cats."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,This was my third attempt to try and find a split leash for my two mini Aussies. It's light and very comfortable. It doesn't drag on the ground and the handle is cushioned which I wasn't expecting. Will buy from this retailer again when the need comes!
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside. Highly recommend this litter, especially for multiple cats!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"i got the exo terra one, its awesome, spend a lil more and do it right. your reptile will love your for it. there you go, i hope this helps."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"So fun, my dog loves these. Got a few different types of bottles. I cant help but laugh every time I see him walking around with a beer bottle in his mouth.
Would have been 5 stars but after about a month he chewed the caps off the tops.  Still got 4 because hes a 90lb American bulldog/pit that would have probably been able to chew the caps off if they were made of metal."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My cat loves this, and Id also like to add when using his litter box the smell has decreased. I will cont to purchase this product as well as other natural balance products for him.
I was having a hard time finding a dry food as well as a wet food he preferred, he hasn't turned his nose up to any of their products yet."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Great product.  Saves time, trip, and money from standing in line at Petco.  I and others I know will be back to order more."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,I purchased this package because the pads on the original filter is getting thinner and thinner. These pads are so much thicker and seems more durable. The four pads fit perfectly in my filter. I have not use the carbons as of today. I purchased them together because of the price and have these carbons as replacement in the future.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,My dog absolutely loves these treats!  Two paws up!
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Very good dog food.  Like the healthy components of it very much because i'm careful about what I feed my dogs.  The good news is, they liked it too.  recommended for those avoiding grains."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Great self-priming siphon vacuum! Perfect for my 5 gallon tanks!
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,Beautiful. But the embroidery gets snagged when she scratches. Not great for everyday wear.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"They changed the packaging and name. My dog is super picky, even with treats. He loves his vitamins!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,Required for MN 4-H for advanced obedience class.  My lab hated it.  He doesn't pick up.  I want to try to float it in the lake and have him get used to it that way.  It as fine.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Very happy with the results!  My dogs were with a pet sitter for a week and used our landing instead of going outside. I was horrified. I cleaned everything right away, but had to watch them like a hawk. I was afraid they would re-soil the area. They did a few times. I ordered this and went over every area of carpet in my home. It gave me peace of mind to find all the spots and treat them. They don't seem to be sniffing around the landing like they were. I still keep an eye on them on the landing, but I am feeling much more confident."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Great item. Doesn't work for all cats but that doesn't mean the product is bad. Some of my cats don't like catnip. Just know your cats.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I had been feeding my two Beagles raw Chicken for over a year which was fine in the beginning. Then my female Beagle suddenly got allergies. After two shots of Prednisone, two rounds of oral Prednisone (all spread out in a span on 6 months), and a change in diet (cooked Potatoes and Fish/Beef), she still had allergies! I started giving them Natural Balance Vegetarian and all her allergies instantly went away. They have been on it for two weeks now.

Since I felt they needed protein, I gave them 1/4 lb. of raw beef each last night. They both instantly started to itch! I also bought Yoghurt so I guess I will just stick to that for protein for now."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,I was using a competitor but switched to this to see. The way it was shipped was worth sticking with this. I have had other companies bottles leak everywhere or be slightly damaged. First bottle here was great. It's working well and my dog loves it. I don't notice a fishy smell but if there was he would love it even more.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum.
Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.

I hope you find this review helpful and think if you just give Cat's Pride Fresh and Light a try you will never buy any other brand again!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"According to my Discerning Pair fo Feline Creatures, ""This is, ""The Stuff !"""
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"These work great with our cat! She tends to try and scratch our leather furniture and wooden door frames, so these work wonders. Once she starts scratching the area, the sticky tape deters her and she quickly stops in the act, annoyed. While it doesn't stop the behavior, it certainly does its function well - 5 stars!"
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Crate was delivered promptly and packaging was in good condition.  The plastic pan is good quality and it was in good condition.  The only issues that I saw are the number of doors and the thickness of the wire cage.  The fact that this cage only has two door eliminates you being able to put two pups in or take two pups out of the kennel with ease.  You would have to remove the center divider.  The other potential issue is the lightweight gauge steel that the kennel is made out of.  Our two GSD pups get excited when we come home and jump on the kennel walls.  The walls are flex enough that the pups can actually open the side door when they jump on it.  For the price point though, this kennel was a really good deal."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My cat wouldn't get in the first one, so she got in this one!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"This might work for a small dog who stays inside but I needed this to keep the white coat clean of a great pyrenees.  It's very thin and did not fit the three tags.  If he runs through branches, this would have torn off the pouch.  I guess I will use clear nail polish on the tags to keep them from discoloring the fur."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,Do not order more than one box as Amazon does not take back even unopened cat food ...something to remember in case your cat does not like
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,Smells great!! Doesn't get up pee that well.. Didn't come with spray top for bottle..
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,We are taking care of an abandoned cat outdoors and I can tell you that this works perfectly! The water stays cold and there is no freezing - no ice at all. We've had quite a bitter winter this year. A lot of 1 digit and below 0 days and it works just great.
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"We were feeding this to our two puppies (Goldens) for the past 7 months. At first they seemed to like it okay and then all of the sudden the last bag of food they weren't interested in it at all. Matter of fact, as hungry as they were, they would leave their entire bowl of food, untouched all day long. Only at night would they eat a TINY tad, only enough to basically sustain life out of starvation. One of the puppies started looking thinner and mind you, these ""puppies"" are already between 60-65 pounds each so I know they had be hungry. I started doing my own research on the food to try to see if others were experiencing this behavior with their dogs also. While I hadn't been buying this food on Amazon, I was buying it at our local pet food store, I still feel compelled to let everyone know that consumer affairs has a lot of complaints about this food, with the same exact symptoms as a lot of people on Amazon have and the same as we had with our two puppies, refusing to eat and loose stools. I returned the last bag I had purchased from the pet food store today and replaced their food with ""Zignature"" limited ingredient dog food and let me tell you, these dogs tore it up!! As soon as I sat their bowls down they started gobbling their food up. No I am not an employee of Zignature or paid by the company, this is just my honest review. So if your dog's refusing to eat or only nibbling at their bowl of TOTW and have loose stool or diarrhea, you may want to think about changing foods. Look up the consumer complaints yourself."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Wonderful vest.  Comfortable, easy to put on, and my puppy who is in training to be a therapy dog loves it."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My dog has been using these for years. When the rubber goes, I buy new ones."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Great product -- well made -- easy to adjust and easy to put on -- I have a three year old, 90 lb Golden Ret and it works well (XL) -- Recpmmend"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Still holding up after a year with a tough chewer.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Oliver is a maniac for this thing. He's a triped and had a long tube thing, then we got this and he loves it even more. One end comes with a dangle toy attached but he ripped it off pretty quickly, I was able to sew it back on. One of the tubes is made from crinkle material which is awesome. Oliver loves to play in it, hang out in it, and take naps in it too. Great deal for this item. Cat games and toys cost 3-4 times as much in the pet stores."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"Beware!! I purchased this a year ago and just bought a second one. It's supposed to be the exact same item, but the new one is very flimsy and much smaller. I'm going to try to return it. I doubt this new version will hold up."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,My cats just love these and I love that they are one ingredient treats.
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"Too flimsy for a large iguana. It was like waling a St. Bernard with dental floss! He easily slipped out of it and I almost lost him; not to mention the tail smacks that I got, leaving red marks on arms and legs. Would NOT recommend this product for iguanas over 2 feet and/or iguanas that are aggressive and not socialized."
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"I was looking for a ball my collie couldn't destroy (she tears apart everything and has a special obsession with balls). This ball seems well made, but it is very large and not pliable enough to where she can pick it up. She pushed it around the living room for the first afternoon, but then gave up and never touched it again. I ended up bringing it over to a friends house for his much larger retriever and even she could barely fit this in her mouth. I ordered the 6-inch diameter ball and I suspect this would be great for a big dog with a large mouth, but didn't work for my dog."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"I cant imagin shipping a product that was obviously missing a part. Seriously, either this was created by a machine and boxed by a machine, or the person who packed it doesnt give a darn. I will change the number of stars if someone can ship the missing piece. Temporarily, I put a piece of foam to keep my cats from getting hurt with the exposed sharp staples inside the arm."
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,it can be dangerous if the dog runs it can snap. use caution when using this kind of leash.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"came in on time, nice size cleans up very well, doesn't slide around on the tile floor, works great for our small dogs"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Beagle doesn't like when it goes over her head but it is comfy and doesn't rub her raw anywhere. Other harnesses she was always trying to wiggle out of. When she takes off after a smell and reaches the end of the leash, the harness protects her from being jerked back."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,Decent quality of hay. They're quite a lot of the tougher stalks of hay but my guinea pigs like chewing on those. If your pigs don't like the stick like stalks I probably wouldn't buy this particular bag.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Absolutely amazing product. A little tricky learning to put on at first but the instructions are extremely helpful. Dog fought it a lil but after two minutes was walking great , acclimated to eat very quickly. 8 month dog used to pull and make walks miserable, its actually unbelievable how well this product works. Thank you, thank you , thank you !!!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Smells good for a dog food and my dogs love it!
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"CANT STAND THE SMELL OF KITTY LITTER ONCED USED. THIS ONE MASKS THE SMELL VERY WELL. I CAN GO WITHOUT CLEANING IT FOR ABOUT 6 DAYS BEFORE MY OCD KICKS IN NOT THE SMELL. I PUT OUT TWO BOXES, ONE UPSTAIRS AND ONE DOWNSTAIRS AND SOMETIMES I FORGET TO CLEAN ONE OF THEM."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My pup has several collars and this makes making him ""legal"" much easier.  City tags and id tag and both be moved very easily!!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"We have two of these. The large would be too big for our dogs. Our dogs range from 14-26 lbs. Good toy, easy for humans to see, less of a trip hazard for bipeds. Nonadjustable, but large kibble would work fine."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Cheaper version of higher priced ones. Does what it needs to for less money.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"This  was a big hit, but a very small bag, so did not last long! It's all good--Romans 8:28--my horses loved it!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Heavens!  This gets all of the hair! :)
By the way - much less expensive to buy this online instead of Petsmart - (As if you did not know already otherwise you would not be shopping here).
One pass over your friendly feline, and it will already have a ton of hair.  I like to sit with my kitty in my lap - and by the time I am done brushing her - I usually have another cat.  (Or at least, I could have another one).
Since using this product, I have had to deal with less hairballs, and less shedding in general.  It keeps the fur under control.  Really like this brush - easy to use - and the kitty loves it too."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My cat has asthma and this litter has been a god-send. Clumps really, really well. I tried to switch her back to regular cat litter, but she began having asthma attacks again. This stuff works!  It does not cure her asthma, but is not as much of an irritant as regular litter."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,My dogs love these and they are good for their teeth.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My Yorkie loves his wee wee tray and, thank heavens, knows how to use it!  The top clips onto the base and secures the pad which prevents liquid from leaking off the edge.  This is a must have item."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I bought this for my shephard mix. Perfect size for her. At first she was skeptical about going in it, but now she absolutely loves it. It is her ""room"" and one can tell she feels absolutely comfortable in it. Easy to assemble, the double door is great because you can set it up however you want at home, and it even has a divider that comes in handy when potty training."
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"Not for bigger dogs, destroyed in one hour, the bunny toy lasted a week or so."
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,I really didn't like these to much. They are small but the rounded tips are a little to big for trimming around the eyes.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,Some rope toys are too thin for large dogs.  This one is a thicker rope toy and offers hours a tug related fun for one of my dogs.  These work well to floss dogs teeth if they like to chew on them.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Clumps how you need it to. The smell is abated fairly well. We have 2 cats so it works as described.
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,I put my bull dog on this product and was certainly seeing nice muscle tone but my dog is pretty sensitive and she started getting acid reflux and having issues so I was not able to continue using the product but I would say for the couple weeks she was able to use it I did notice good result with her body structure and her energy levels were nice and her skin and coat looked good. She has a lot of allergies naturally so this just wasn't something she could take but if you don't have a sensitive dog I would recommend it because it does have great ingredients and no fillers.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I have switched my dog from a mix of hills science diet and Rachel ray grain free nutrish (salmon)  to this over the past week.  He is a growing Bassett hound, 10 mo;  I know not everyone would consider this a large breed because  he is short, but I know that his breed can get up to 70 pounds full-grown.  He seems to like  The flavor so far, but he is not a terribly picky eater. I have been transitioning him  slowly on a graduated mix;  I have noticed that his stools, while still formed, have been a lot softer on the Iams mix.  Some of this I realize has to do with any kind of dietary change,  so I will wait a little longer before giving my final opinion on that. This product lost only one star because the grain size makes this food a little harder to eat than others (including Eukanuba large breed, which he has tried before).  Other than that, it is a good product at a fair price and keeping my dog nourished at his high activity level.

Update:  dog still likes it and his poops are nice and firm, but the problem is that the grain size is so large, it is clogging my auto feeder. For that reason alone, I cannot buy it again."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,No problem with delivery. My dog loves it. A little big for him but he does not care.
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"The discus seem to not care about it at all.  They will eat almost anything I put in there but this.  However, the bottom feeders love it."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Bought this for my baby rescue squirrel. He loves it. I can always find him curled up asleep right next to it. It has also been washed and dried several times and is still holding up.
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"My kitty doesn't care at all for the bug, and the wire is much too stiff, so we put bird feathers on it and he will play with it from time to time."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Helps my dog not completely gobble all of his food down. The rubber bottom also helps on a hard floor to keep the bowl from sliding too much. Much more healthy for my dog to not gobble his food down in 2.1 seconds, this way it takes him about a minute to eat his food which is a huge improvement."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"This is advertised good and safe for rats. However, 47 of my 50 rats had serious eye problems. Itchy, redness, inflammation, and even red tears. I would never buy this product for my rats again."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I have had dogs for over 30 years and have used a wide variety of crates. I currently own the larger MidWest iCrate, a larger 'generic brand' crate, this size in 'generic brand', and an extra large all steel crate, along with many airline style travel crates.

When I recently acquired a new 4 pound puppy, the MidWest iCrate was my first choice in new crates to buy for him.  The 24 inch size is ideal for this size puppy and the 12 pound dog he will grow into.  The crate is NOT meant to be used for a puppy that is going to grow into a very big dog (such as a Golden Retriever or Labrador).  It is just not sturdy enough for a big, strong willed puppy.  In that case, get the crate the puppy will need as an adult and use the barrier the comes with it to divide it when the pup is little.

This crate is meant for a small dog, therefore a small puppy. And for that, it is perfect.  The double set of doors allows you to set it up in a variety of locations and still have access for the pup.  We currently have it set up lengthwise with the side door left open for easy access.  The puppy can come and go as he pleases to access his pee pads at night in the kitchen, and then return to his crate to sleep.  He LOVES his crate and willingly runs to it at night to lay down and sleep while we babygate him in the kitchen. When compared to the generic crate that I have, the MidWest crate is made from a higher gauge wire, it assembles together tighter, and it just seems sturdier overall. The plastic pan is a heavier weight and is holding up well.

I definitely plan on always using MidWest crates in the future."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"the rule is one inch of fish per gallon of water.  i keep 25-30 goldies in a 9 gallon, skim the water daily, I use this sponge filter (don't rinse it in the faucet b/c the chlorine level is 1ppm and will kill the bacterial colony living in the Sponge; rinse it in dechlorinated water). I have a fluval C2 5 stage filter, a 240gal/hr water circulator (fish don't live in stagnant water in the wild), and i use ""Prime"" water conditioner by Seachem.  Also my gravel is colonized (Eco-Complete)- black color.  Add few fake plants and some decorum.  I feed Drs Foster and Smith goldies flakes twice a day, and i make a seafood buffet of shrimp-clams-crab-salmon from the canned seafood department, and feed it twice daily also (one can of each, drained, finely chopped and mixed will last 3 months, so freeze it), alternate with the flakes. In the wild these fish are prey animals (not predators) and they spend the whole day looking for food.  It's a lot easier to do than to write up a review, so give it a go and personalize your tank."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My cat LOVES these!! Its one of the only toys he repeatedly plays with until chunks are taken out and it barely even rolls. With that said, they are relatively durable for awhile but my Cat plays with these daily.
Side note: Ive never seen any dye or any residue in his mouth or on the floor so they seem safe in that regard."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Most products don't wow me - this one does. It works EXACTLY how it is advertised. It literally took 2 minutes to clean the litterbox and that includes the litter mess the cat left on the floor (he's an jerk - not the product's fault).
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"I can't fathom how the glowing reviews on this product could possibly be real. I just received mine yesterday, just in time to pick my cat up from the vet, after having surgery.

I live in New York City so I don't have a car, and probably wheel it around more than most people will. The shoulder straps for the carrier can't be removed. When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.

The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.

I would NOT recommend buying this carrier. I've had it for 24 hours, and it already looks like it's years old."
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"This is impossible to keep clean.  I empty the water completely and refill daily, and I take the stupid thing apart and clean it thoroughly weekly, but it still gets slimy and icky.  Taking it apart and cleaning should be simple and straightforward.  They are not.  Even with sponges, bottle brushes and toothpicks, there are still crevices that stubbornly hold on to the goobies that end up in my cats water.  Taking the motor apart is a huge pain, and I didn't even know I was supposed to do that until I dropped the unit while cleaning, and the lever that is supposed to control the water flow (that, in fact, does nothing) broke off.  I looked inside the motor and found slimy cat hairs and a goobie the size of marbles stuck inside!  You shouldn't have to break something to figure out you need to clean it.  I had been scrubbing the motor's plastic grating with an old toothbrush, but that wasn't enough work I guess.

My cats love it, but I will never purchase another one. I'll find a bubbly fountain that provides safe and clean water to the cats without driving the humans crazy!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Excellent Product I purchase it with a promotional code from the seller. I recommend the product is super good quality and is as described. It came in perfect conditions and it shipped fast.

If I have to buy again I buy it without concerns because is super useful and looks perfect."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"If they are shipped right they are supposed to be firm blocks that's easily crumbled into powdery flaky smell so good goodness for the cats (it appeals to my sense of smell and I HATE the smell of any wet can food)

I have no idea why people don't bother to just crumble it the way I do is just squeeze it firmly and add water and nutritional yeast (for the one cat with on/off diarrhea) and just give it a good stir. It takes less than a minute tops to be throughly mixed and water is absorbed. The cats do like it dry too but I rather have water in it to give them more moisture in their diet as they eat Orijen dry cat food. I also give them Stella and Chewys freeze dried food added into the mix some days as they eat that for treats.

My bengal is the picky eater the American Bobtail is the one with sensitive tummy and the sole reason why I brought a trail sized bag to test run it to give her supplements and she likes it as well as the Bengal so cant go wrong with this product but I strongly suggest you to purchase the trail size to test run it. Just crumble it its so easy to squeeze it and seeing it just flake away. I like the ease of grabbing a firm block instead of a messy thing."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Great dog food. Made in usa.in Tewksbury ma. My home town. Read the ingredients has all great stuff in it
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Too short for my needs, but its a good leash.  I'll just donate it to the animal shelter, that way it isn't a complete loss."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,These are really good little squirrels for the log toy.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,My dogs have eaten every one of their treats - will look for them again and purchase them again .
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Been using this on a 100lb mixed breed once per month and have had no problems with ticks despite a bumper crop of the little suckers in this neck of the woods. Dog swims frequently and this doesn't seem to diminish the effectiveness. I have found a couple of dead ticks in the dog's bed but I understand this is common. Can't beat the price compared with Frontline.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,This is wonderful for the backseat of our Chevy Cruze and two Toy Fox Terriers. The price is much better than the Snoozer brand I have in our CRV.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I was so surprised by how large this actually is. My dogs love it. Packaging is great, but a little wasteful. I mean, this product obviously isn't going to get damaged, but it had a huge box and packing bubbles. The toy is really long and flat, no stuffing at all. It has three squeakers in it. SO annoying, but I buy them anyway because my dogs can't get enough. I love that it is so long because the dogs can both rough house with the same toy while they're playing. And little shards aren't all over the place like with the rope bones. The stitching and material must be pretty impressive because my dogs have rolled, wrestled and been nuts with this thing and it is still holding up after 48 hours. I don't think it will last the weekend, but it has already outlasted most of their rope bones and other toys. (Other than chuck it balls, those things are truly indestructible). Great fabric, great toy!! My doggies love it :)"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"So. our cat's breath was not that great and we thought maybe he needed some dental treats (because honestly, no cat wants their teeth brushed by a person or some crap sprayed in the back of their throat) but Ghost the cat has a sensitive stomach and treats make him barf. On a whim, we decided maybe he would like these 2 dollar sticks that are NATURAL and good for chewing, teething, and oral hygiene. AND THE STICKS CAME IN TODAY. We gave him one to start out with so he doesn't get bored with a bunch of sticks at once. Well, he won't let it go except to play fetch. It's his new favorite thing ever. He loves it. He's going absolutely crazy. He only gets this way for feather toys and catnip sticks now apparently. GOOD BUY. Worth the money if you know how to keep cat toys interesting. Just play with your cat. (Try throwing the stick or waving it around."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Switched to this recently and we're in the process of mixing it with her old food. But she digs her nose around trying to get these like bits first before her old nuggets lol
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"This is our first time trying these treats and I gave one to my dog and I turned around for a few seconds and it was completely gone, I thought maybe she lost it but I looked everywhere and it was gone.  Wow, she really loves these treats and I like the ingredients.  As far as her teeth being cleaner I didn't notice a difference but her breath smelled better then usual."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I used the bottom to store a 28lbs bag of litter, and the top for 4lbs of dry food with room to spare. The wheels were simple to install and rolls across the floor just fine. Works perfectly and I love that it comes with a scoop, which we use to add fresh litter."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My 21 month old, 50 pound lab mix needs something to chew on every day. He chews between 30 minutes to one hour daily. Most toys he can destroy in a day or less. This includes the giant ropes! The only chew toys that last are heavy duty Kong toys and these Nylabones. He prefers the nylabones and rarely goes for the Kong toys. I keep two or three different shape and textured nylabones out for him all the time and replace them every 9 to 12 months. That's about how long it takes him to chew it down to about two inches. This regular shaped bone and the wishbone are his favorites over the heavily textured type. I can't tell the difference by smell of the different flavors and he doesn't prefer one flavor over another either. I like these over real bones because he isn't able to chew off a sharp chunk and swallow it. These shred in small bits like sawdust and won't hurt your pet if swallowed. The Dura chews keep my pup content and away from the shoes and furniture so we are both happy campers!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I started giving this to my dog after she had ACL surgery and I think it keeps her in better shape. It's hard to find, so I'm glad Amazon carries it and at a great price."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"I have not yet shot with this scope, NOT YET MOUNTED.  1)  It took over 4 weeks to receive it from time of ordering.  2)  The whole scope was covered with dust.  3)  The objective lens had smear marks on it but cleaned with a microfiber cloth alright.  4)  When I took the lens caps off after the 4 day return policy had expired, much to my surprise I discovered that the objective lens tube AT THE END was FLAT for about 2 inches instead of round.  The tube is NOT flat anywhere at the objective lens itself, but at the end of the scope.  That is more than a drop - that is someone sending me a scope from China that was mis-manufactured and hoping I'd never take the lens cover off I guess.  Since I'm stuck with the flawed product, I will still try shooting long range with it and report more later."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Nice and light weight. Too small for my child with glasses tho.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I love this hoodie!  I wear it frequently, size is right, cool looking, and the price is right!  Good purchase."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Fits my 43 perfect and is a nice personal touch. Priced right, all gtg"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,So far so good..does a great job for 100yrd spotting and boat watching at beach
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I needed a soft silicone case to use so I could change the battery often.  This one fits, I would purchase again!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Comfortable inside he pants holster that fits my bodyguard 380 perfectly. I love how comfortable it is to wear, how secure my pistol is and the concealability it provides...would definitely recommend. I also have this same holster for my glock 27, perfect."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"As you will see in the attached image, I have thick thighs and a slightly big butt for my size but I usually wear a medium in compression pants, the smalls fit but are difficult to get into, but the mediums are usually perfect. This medium feels like an XS, and I had to squeeze my way in there. If I would have gotten a large it may have fit much better. I love the waist though, I have a small waist and usually high waisted pants don't fit well because of the size difference between my hips and my waist, but since these run a bit small it fits me well at the waist. I also like the feel of the fabric, its soft, and even though it stretched a bit when I put it on as compression pants do, the fabric didn't become see-through like some yoga pants sometimes do. I need to test that in the sun but so far so good. I included the shot for reference, as I find it helps me when buying clothes online to see real women wearing the clothes, and I can almost never find someone with my shape, so I hope it helps women with a similar body type. I received these pants at a discount in exchange for an honest review, however that did not affect my opinion of the product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"love the pants;;;;;great fit ,and great look,great price. they were comfortable through out my work out and I love the colors. I ordered myself another pair liked so much;;;;;;"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Not as good as a Boyt but like it for what it does.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Most reviews only had bad things to say about the on/off button.  Seems OK for me...  Overall a solid light!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I needed a fun and exciting way to workout while I am stuck in my ""ice palace"" during winter. Seriously my driveway gets too slippery to drive down so for much of the winter months I am stuck inside.

Zumba is fun, love the music and so does my one year old son who dances and tries to follow along with me.

Almost instant results happened for me. I started feeling better and happier after the first run through. I noticed weight begin to slip off little by little and suddenly I was at my pre baby weight in two weeks! I get that results like that are not too common, but stress was holding the weight on me and Zumba really helped my stress levels.

Fun and exciting. I am a big fan!!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Great for hiding the cash and cards that we need to have on us but don't want people to see.  Now just have to remember to go to a quiet and private place to use it instead of showing bad guys what we have and where we have it.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Seems to be more heavy duty than the version with an arm on it. I prefer this model.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Great product and a great seller...would buy again and likely will in the future.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Original fit bit wristband broke. This is been a great replacement. Great quality even better price.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I ordered 1 pair and  used them for the whole day. Having 4 surgerys on my fused ankle W/24
screws. They were so comfortable & look more stylish, than elderly looking compression socks.
I ordered 6 pair immediately. Great compression socks !"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"At a glance upon arrival I was a little worried. The shorts were tiny but it turned out they were a good fit. The material isn't thin and weightless, but its' a solid material that is comfortable. I like how the shorts go down towards the knee. I received a discount on this product through Amazon Review Trader, and the deal made it all especially worth it. Also, the shipment came on time."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Used it for the first time yesterday and it worked great.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Love this sight. It works great. Would recommend to anyone that needs a little red dot sight. Have it mounted on a 22 and its light and perfect. Can't say enough good about it!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bought the replacement mat as my old one had rotted from sun damage. I have never replaced a mat before and was a little worried. But no need to worry. It fit perfect for my 12' trampoline bought from Walmart a few years back, and worked great. Not too hard and not too soft. Perfect. I highly recommend this"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This is the perfect case to house the Minelab CTX 3030 Metal Detector! I purchased the angled bow case from Plano but at 20 lbs. it was way too heavy. So I tried this rectangle case and it is the Perfect fit for the CTX 3030. The detector does not slip around inside the case. The case is weather proof and rugged and with the adjustable screw in pillars one can make it into any configuration desired!
I couldn't be more pleased with this solid case."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"My front light got stolen the first day I put it on while parked at my gym so it's hard to say how well this works.
I actually purchased another straight away. I will just have to remember to take it off every time I hope it lasts a while. Now, on the replacement, I cannot really say how well it lights my way because it is flooding in Houston and I'm not riding. But, the seller sent an email to ask me to review (I do loathe this new practice, as I typically don't use such products that soon and I HATE getting extra emails-like I don't get enough already). For this practice I dinged a star just because I hate the reminder so very much. I rate my products in groups as time permits, not as soon as I get it. Ridiculous."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"6'1"", 159 pounds, cyclist build, ordered a Large. The jersey was nearly baggy but certainly wearable. The problem was with the bib shorts - the openings for the legs were so small making the shorts so tight to pull on that I fear the seams would rip within a couple rides. The shoulder strap material also isn't as robust as other similarly priced kits that I own. Mostly returning due to the size mismatch between the jersey and bib shorts."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,A lot of people who have reviewed this talk about the extenders not being attached securely enough.  I would have to assume something has been changed on the rack because mine did have a way to tighten the extenders.  I just installed this and put one of my axiom 45L panniers on it and it fit fine  I put this on my 2009 Surly Travelers Check and it seems to be sturdy I think it would hold a lot more than the listed 45 lbs (Not that you would enjoy steering your bike with anything more than that on it)  This is great for bikes like mine that did not have mid blade fork eyelets.  I would have prefered the steel Surly rack however that was 35 dollars more and the replacement fork for my Travelers Check would have been another 100 dollars.  To be clear I have not actually used this rack yet I just was stoked to find out that the rack is a lot sturdier than a lot of the reviews lead me to believe.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I love this bag.  No, seriously, I don't mean I like it.  I mean I am kind of emotionally attached to it.  It's the feeling you get from relying on a tool that is perfectly made.

Despite being pretty small to look at, this bag holds everything.  The main pocket is an ok size and can fit everything that needs to go in there -- 1 L water bottle, bike lock, keys, light jacket, wallet, phone.  The pannier pockets are enormous when unfolded and can fit everything I can throw at them.  3 L water bladder?  Sure, with plenty of room to spare.  Groceries, including a few bunches of flowers?  Yep, no big deal.  Plus there's a convenient handle on the top to tote it around.

Here is what I managed to fit in the bag on a recent shopping trip:
4 heads of cauliflower (!!), 6 bananas, 2 18-oz jars of jelly, 1 1-kilogram canister of yogurt, 1 1-lb jar of peanut butter, 1 1-lb loaf of bread, 1 1-lb bottle of vinegar, 1 1-lb box of spaghetti, ~2 lbs of brussel sprouts, 1 20 oz water bottle

The Topeak system is great and means I never have to worry about the bag falling off, no matter how rugged the pavement is, or mess around with bungee cords.

If I were to have any complaint about this bag at all, it's that it doesn't have a thing on the back that's designed for a bike light to attach to.  I've clipped my light to the cord in the back and used one of the clip things on the bag to stabilize it and it's fine, but it doesn't have a designed placement that keeps the light from bouncing out of position and not facing perfectly back.  But that's a super minor complaint about what is really a fantastic bag."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"These are typical high Ottis quality, and allow me to select the right type of brush for whatever gun cleaning task I may have."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"A lot less grip than I had envisioned.  I have thin fingers and the grips just didn't fit right.  Finish on the grips is excellent, just didn't care for them."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,This are a great cheap way to protect your cards. If you are buying them for Legendary the deck building game I would say: be prepared for them to fit a little loose.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Fit m22 and walther ppx. Only problem is mag for ppx won't fit in mag pouch. But the m22 mag fits great. Now if I can only buy a second mag for my m22!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Trailer tows very well. It is light but heavy enough not to bounce around. The length seems just right for a stable ride as well.
Instructions were very good. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it came with LED lighting. I didn't use the lights that came with it instead upgrading to LED lights.
Handles two 50 pound Kayaks without any problem."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Exactly what I needed.  I am always losing my chargers.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"For the price I am not sure it can be beat. I have used it during several rounds and it is within a few yards of much higher priced range finders and GPS watches that my friends use. Pin lock will at times lock right on with the same reading each time. Other times, it will take a bit and give me a different reading each time but never more than 3-7 yards of variance. Different readings each time is a pain but I am not that accurate with my irons anyway so it is not a deal breaker for me. As long as this unit lasts I consider this a huge win."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Best production flipper money can buy.  Great execution, steel, action and aesthetics.  I really enjoy the titanium frame, it has a unique feeling.  This knife needed a few days for break-in, now it's lightning fast and flips to lock 100% of the time.  This is my third ZT.  I'm sure it won't be my last."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Nice bag, thinner than I expected but works out great for the low profile carrier. You can easily fit 2-3 rackets. With 2, you can also fit a can of balls and change of shirt. Side pocket conveniently holds keys, phone, etc. If you want a lot more room for clothes, more balls, etc, get a larger size bag. This one is perfect on the thinner side if that's your preference. Great looking bag and well made."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This is a great knee brace for doing any lifting that requires bending your knee.  It is way more secure than I thought it was going to be.  I usually use a knee brace that has adjustable straps, since I've experienced a lot of slippage with knee sleeves.  This however is an exception.  I did size down one to ensure a tight fit.  It is made of good material and is very sturdy. Most products from bear grips has great quality.  They obviously put a lot into the products they sell to their consumers.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,Not the highest quality but it's worked fine for me and will be great for occasional use
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Took it shooting yesterday. Only took 6 rds to get it dialed in at 50 yards right out of the box!! The clarity outside in actual use was far better than what I thought while looking through it inside my house at night, from 3x all through 12x. The side parallax adjustment is great as well. I was able to ring steel at 200 with boring regularity, and it didn't seem to lose zero after 100 rounds of .308. Only complaint is that there is a little bit of distortion and the edges of the filed of view, but it's only noticeable if you intentionally look at the edges.

The illuminated reticle uses a light that washes all over the inside of the scope, not just on the crosshairs, so that is a bit of an annoyance, but I don't forsee myself using the illuminated reticle. Just putting that out for those that will.

The rings that come with the scope appear to be of phenomenal quality, every bit as good as the Warne rings I purchased for another rifle. There are 4 screws per ring that tighten around the tube, which I feel provides a far more secure mount.

I wish the rings positioned it a hair higher, but overall I am extremely pleased with the performance of the scope. Even more so considering for my $113 delivered to my door, I got a set of rings that seem every bit as good as the last 30mm rings I got from Warne for another AR.

I would say this would make a great scope for someone looking for a decent scope on a budget, especially considering it's a 30mm tube!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,These things are awesome! I teach fitness in doors and out doors and I can't always find something to attach my fitness bands to.  This makes it so much easier for my clients and for me. They are strong and durable.  I love that I can travel with them and that they come with a pouch to carry them in.  I did purchase these at a reduced fee for my positive review.  I'm very happy with them.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,This is the kind of glove I used years ago as a kid. They fit well and are comfortable. Great retro look as well.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Works very well, however, I did not expect plastic, but it seems to be holding up well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,matched right up to both my camera tripod and my new Bushnell Ultra HD 10x 42 roof prisms.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"As good as they get, unless you step up to the >$100 range.
Smaller than expected.
No problem attaching it to the bike
Bright enough to see by, if you  have young eyes like my daughter.
Not had it long enough to judge battery life"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I'm gonna give you the begginers outlook. I am only on day 3. I've done kick boxing and football so I'm not out of shape in the sense of not working out. I've had 3 knee surgeries and have fractured my ankle on my dominant (right) side. My dad is a pastor and a physical therapist healing hands I guess is why he toon that route. Anyway so I always got in homehelp but my body has gotten stiff over the years with cartledge and joint discomfort. We are talking complete subluxation (dislocation) of my knee caps from the sockets. So when I say I feel it in my quads, my hams, and my knees you better believe it. I don't know how well it's gonna play out but we will see. I'm 300 pounds 6'3 and I ain't obese theres a tone of muscle  on me due to I got into weight lifting. Yes I know it's not great on my knees to add weight but I'm trying to build my legs as well. So far Tai cheng has proven to be the hardest leg workout I've done thus far. I also enjoy it he talks to you not at you which is hard considering he's on TV not in person. My dad has seen the visa and if you're wondering if Dr. Cheng knows his stuff take in consideration NY dad a physical therapist for 20+ years said it's simple but effective since it's trying to make your body work naturally."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,This is how all folding chairs should be made. You get four commercial grade heavy-duty chairs that look like they will last a lifetime. They are constructed from high-density polyethylene and have a powder coated steel frame. This allows the chairs to handle a sitting 400 pound person or a 300 pound person that is standing on it. I can tell right after unpacking them that they will be able to take a beating from heavy usage. They have contoured seats and backs. I noticed that they are so much more comfortable then the common all-metal folding chairs. I have sat in the Cosco chairs for over an hour with zero issues and I could have sat longer if I needed to.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"This food packet will do the trick,  but packaging could be a tighter seal,  guess we will see the longevity of the food."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"This rope is 30ft long and is thin, reflective and lightweight and packs up small. However, the biggest negative for me, and one of the reasons I don't use it much, is because it tangles up so easily. The reflective tape they have woven into the rope makes it tangle even easier than it normally would without the reflective material. But for $12, I'm not going to complain too much."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Excellent quality gloves! These fit both mine and my husbands hands comfortably and securely thanks to the Velcro wrist closure. We use these a few times a week with our punching bag and they've held up very nicely. No rips or tears and they have a good amount of padding.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I've been using this for about 75 miles and am enjoying it so far.  I don't know that I can tell the difference between this and Lizardskins 3.2, but this seems to stay put better.  It seems durable, which should be perfect for my type of riding.

Also, this stuff is almost 3 times heavier than lizardskins if you're into that kind of thing."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Have not used it but looks great.  Fast shipping great deal.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"BEST WATER BOTTLE EVER!!! You will NOT regret spending a pretty penny on this bad boy of water bottles. I have thrown all my other water bottles away becasue there is no need to anything else. My drink literally stays COLD; ICE COLD all day long! I'm not kidding. I didn't believe it would, but it really really does. The ice is barely melted by dinner after filling it with my ice and drink in the morning around 7!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Excellent pack for the price.  Not as large as some, but it is for my teenage son for scouting and he rarely changes clothes on a campout anyway."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Very good quality.  I am glad I bought these.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,Hatchet arrived covered in some oily substance that smelled and left black marks on hands. Perhaps like curing a cast iron pan however this isn't iron. Looked used. Heavy and fits nicely in hand and will be used for son and husband as they backpack and camp.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,OR,"Its a great little vest! But when you Order MAKE SURE you check that the site has selected the correct size. I had clicked on XS, however XL arrived. So i had to return it. I tried to RE-ORDER the same vest, and realized that each time I clicked on XS, once I looked at the checkout, it said M, or XL again. So strange. So unfortunately, I never re-ordered it. I would have if it had selected the correct size in the check-out."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Does the job. No complaints. Comes coiled up. Its very hard to break the links without the proper tool That says a lot about the quality, very durable. I ended up cutting a link with a saw and then prying it apart. Easy install I recommend buy a chain breaker for the extra 13 bucks just in case you have to sized wrong. Would buy it again!!! Also recommending to Friends with motor vehicles as well!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rotary-9322-Roller-Chain-C-35-3/dp/B0092GSNHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rotary 9322 Roller Chain C-35 3'</a>"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"compass needs recal often, temp is off always, awesome idea execution sub par."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,OR,"Shortly after starting to use this product I developed my first ever case of Pink Eye. The doctor verified that it was not a viral or bacterial infection. I couldn't figure out what it was and the pink eye continued off and on for 6 weeks (the first 2 weeks was pretty severe). I finally put 2 and 2 together and came back to Amazon to read all the 1 Star reviews for this product and could not believe what I was reading. How can a product this dangerous be sold as an anti-fog solution that you put next to your eyes? I threw the product away and my eyes have fortunately cleared up. However, I spent a couple of hundred dollars on new contact lenses and eye doctor appointments."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,I love this stuff!  I Buy it almost on a monthly basic for different various used.  I always make sure to buy the Paracord Planet brand because I know it will be great quality.  The colors are always spot on and lengths are generous.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Perfect fit, great price.  Revived the helmet to functional use.  Beats buying a new helmet when the helmet is in excellent condition."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,This is a great light for the price.  Seriously it far exceeds my expectations and I happily recommend it to all who ask about it when out for a ride.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"This appears to be a nice lightweight hat. Unfortunately, it runs too small for a ""one size fits all"". Most of these hats will fit heads up to 60cm of circumference or so. I doubt this hat will fit people with heads over 58cm. If you have problems with ""one size fits all"" caps, this hat is definitely not for you."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Spoon is LARGE, Fork just sturdy enough, knife will cut if don't expect it to cut anything tough; really like way they lock together.  Very light weight which is both advantage and disadvantage -- great for not adding much carry weight. not so good for sturdy factor or comfort of use."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,These Frankford caliber specific trays are awesome! The trays are about 25% smaller than a universal tray making it much easier to navigate a drop powder loader for 50 rounds. I now have one of theses for ever caliber I reload and have thrown out the universal ones.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,I own the 4x16 and the 4x12 models of this scope. They are clear and sturdy. I have one on an M&P 10 and I can put 10 shots touching at 100 yards. I would give these scopes a 10 star review if I could. Why pay 1200$ for a scope when these will do the same job and not lose zero.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"The design of this Poncho is better than U.S. Military issue: It has snaps that create sleeves for your arms making it easier to do things without the rain seeping in. However, it still functions well as a small tarp. The quality is good and it is very light weight and compact, even if the camo looks a little weird; after having for a while, I'm getting where I kind of like it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Smaller in real life than I would have thought. Glad I bought 2. Very soft and very well made.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Nice looking. Well made. Comfortable. Folds and travels very well.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Was disappointed in the twist shifters and response from the stock brake levers on my daughters bike so I bought these as a replacement and they are very nice. No complaints.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"Does the job, but build quality seems less than great. Good for the price. You get what you pay for."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This is a great quality product from Bodylastics. The color shown for this is blue and the one I received is an army green. It doesn't really matter but I would have preferred the blue. I bought this so my wife and I would each have a pair of handles. I had bought the Bodylastic Max MT Warrior to go with this which only includes one set of handles. Bands will give you a great workout. There's no reason to have a big collection of dumbbells in the way of your living space with these easy to put away bands. I bought a Moen vaccum grab bar handle to secure to a big window, and I can adjust different heights to the bands with it. Moen LR2308W Home Care 12-Inch Suction Balance Assist Bath Grip. It works great."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,For the price I'm very pleased with these rings. They look good and are very comfortable. I feel like they could be a little more durable but for the price I would recommend these to anyone.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Nice little cooler, live that the rigid insert is removable to be cleaned."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"The fitness ball package comes with everything you need to get going. The ball, the pump, and access to some basic stretches/exercises. The ball is durable and as described. It holds even with sweat which is nice for stretching post hard workouts."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"The moment I received this product, I tested it in couple of ways, as in the past we have lost one phone to water already. I put the paper napkin inside the waist pouch, sealed it with zip locks and ran water from sink faucet on it, specifically water directed in the the opening. It passed the test!
Now placed the pouch and the phone case in the bath tub overnight ;) I'm really happy that it passed this test too. This is really good product for our phone gadgets and will definitely recommend. I loved the 3 zip locks and folds on pouch and locks on phone case. The locks don't appear to be made from cheaper material when operated so thats excellent! The bags are flexible and lighter as I like them to be."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Nice product, mounted easily. Perfect for keeping a paddle secure"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Very convenient, but like a purse, you just want more storage. It did come off during storage of my folding knee scooter, but it was easy to put back on."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I have back and foot injuries, so low impact exercising is a must for me at the moment (hoping this will someday change). This trampoline is about as low impact as a a vertical land/terrestrial unit can be.

The first few times I tried this trampoline, I had to focus on balance, but I adjusted quickly enough. Because spring coils are not used in this trampoline, it has a quieter action than traditional mini trampolines. It is a very sturdy unit. Absolutely love this thing. The ""petals"" help to widen the jumping surface, and also help warn me (when my foot feels the petal edges) when I am straying too far from the center of the trampoline. My college age daughter now comes to my room every day to exercise on the trampoline as well :).

If I were going to purchase this item again, I would consider springing for the larger size. I think that a larger surface would allow for my complex moves during exercise sessions. I won't take any points off for this, though, since I was aware of the measurements when I placed my order."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Nice basic bar ends. They installed easily and seem sturdy. Time will tell if they are durable. Only fault is the plastic caps are a bit loose fitting and may not last long.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I did not buy this for hanging deer. I built a 9'x8' shelf in my garage and established it at about 4.5 feet so a car's nose could go under it, but there would still be sufficient room to store meaningful items on top of it (like snow blowers, lawn mowers, generators, etc...). The problem is getting the seasonal equipment onto the shelf. Most of it is pretty darn heavy. I initially looked into some block & tackle systems but was shocked at the prices for what I considered very modest quality. I finally settled on this as a lift system. I was about a third the cost of the cheapest block & tackle and better quality. I use the hangar part that you affix the deer legs to as the lifting hook and bolted the rest to the ceiling just a few inches out from the shelf. Using this system, I can lift by myself a 150 pound snowthrower 4.5 feet into the air and onto the shelf I made for the season once spring arrives. Bicycles, lawn mowers, BBQ, etc... works great and much more economical than the pulley systems being sold today."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,This product is well made but my slender and tall 9 year old found it to be too uncomfortable and refused to wear it.  We tried several other brands with the same issue until we found the Nutty Buddy System here on Amazon.  It may be more comfortable for children who aren't so slender but didn't work for my son.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Holds the morrell elite super duper good & is very sturdy.  The super duper bag does rest on the bottom bar of the stand just a bit though.  Went together easy & going on 3 months of heavy use with no issues so far!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Easy to install. Allows for better recoil control. It will significantly increase the grip diameter however. Not for small hands.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,An excellent choice for use as a durable lightweight stand bag for use on the driving range or on the course. Highly recommend this bag.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,These compression shorts are a perfect fit and excellent for any outdoor activity in the warmer months.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,OR,These weights work just fine but Amazon shows a picture of a different more expensive set than what they send to you. They have a picture of a set of weights in a red plastic box that has 5 weights sitting in the foam rubber beside of the plastic box of smaller weights. What they sent was just the small box of weights. I could have bought this set of weights at Midwayusa.com and saved over $6. This is not the first time this has happened.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Took 15 shots through one today, and no errors. Sunny day, and the unit simply works."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,I can barely get two or three targets to set before shooting the third or forth makes them fall back down.......It is what it is....not a bad target to shoot pellets at and at least you get some movement and noise. I'm shooting at it with a .22 caliber Beeman Silver Kodiak X2 at around 800 FPS .....25 yards....and it had dented and distorted the targets pretty bad.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,OR,"Worked well for 2 days and then the dial wouldn't get but one station, slipped or IDK :(  Am returning."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Very good goggles nice case it protects it from gaining germs when drop and from breaking
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,I bought with the intention of purting it on my AR15......But i never did. Its well built but just put it on.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I have a MOAB 10 bag that I use as my bug out bag, and as fantastic as it is, there are still times that I trouble getting all of my gear inside the bag, or securely attached to the Molle webbing.  That was until I found these tactical T-Rings.  They are well built and the quality is self evident upon review.  And they work great!  Recommended!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This is a good light hammock.

It is contained in its own pocket so you have no pouch to lose.

It is light and comes with fairly strong rope to attach it to a tree or whatever you can find. If you use it much I would suggest investing in tree friendly straps so you don't damage the trees that you use.

It is very easy to put up and it can be done solo with no problem. It is advisable that you look up how to tie specific knots especially for hammocks. You don't want to hit the ground while you are relaxing in the hammock because your knot wasn't done correctly. I've done that and its not fun.

This is a good hammock.

I received a free sample for the purpose of reviewing and evaluating in an honest and unbiased manner."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,This latch powerlifting belt is 10mm thick. It's huge and very supportive for those heavy squats or dead lifts. I do recommend this if you are pushing some high weight. The latch buckle is pretty easy to adjust. You do need a screwdriver to set the amount of pressure you want. I'm a 32 to 33 waist but I have it on the lowest tightest openings. I may need to drill a hole or two otherwise great products I do recommend for powerlifting. I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Almost as good as sex. These are simple & easy to go from one cal. to another just by changing the drum. like these. Price seems reasonable also.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,OR,Within hours the netting ripped. The metal construction isn't great and it warped... I wouldn't recommend this product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,How much do I like this product. Let me put it this way. In no way did I feel like I was screwed with my purchase.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I was not 100% sure that these would fit my 25 year old 14 inch ASMAC bandsaw, which I think was made in Taiwan.  Well, the part hasn't changed at all in 25 years, and it's a perfect match.  Very happy with this buy."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I'm using it on the "" saw blade on my Delta 14"" floor standing band saw for ripping 1/2"" thick x 8' long oak strips. 1/2"" thick doesn't sound like much but it binds my 1/2"" blade in the middle of an 8-foot ripping - combination or underpowered motor and wrong drift angle on my part. Anyway, the stick works really well but doesn't last long as I had to constantly apply it even during the middle of ripping. Need to buy couple more sticks - use about 3"" of the stick after ripping about 600 feet of oak. An additional benefit seems like sawdust doesn't collect on the tires. Looks like the stick will save both tires and saw blade."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,There is a reason it is so inexpensive. It emits a loud buzz when a USB device is plugged into it. And it is so wide that it would be dangerous to install in a metal box or in any box with another device. Spend a few more bucks on a better product.

I had to contact the seller as one of the screens was very discolored and was distracting when someone else was looking at me to talk (it had no effect on me looking out). They were AWESOME and sent out a replacement pair that day!  And THAT is what Customer Service looks like!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"How many times do you find yourself in the kitchen with a sharp knife and an unprotected hand?  I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

I'm a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"...and get prior verification from the seller that you will receive what is advertised, and not a lower quality ""knockoff"".

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Had issues with being outdoors and the unit not turning on.  Appears to have an issues with the battery compartment keeping water out when it rains.  I allowed the unit to dry out and it never came back on, even after several days of sunshine in an effort to see if it would charge.  Worked great up until the rain."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Smart design. Like the fact that the keyring is integral to tool. Issue I normally have with key chain tools is separating the tool from the key, a problem than this tool solves rather well. That said, I have barely used it, and much prefer  the leather-man squirt."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Wasn't too impressed with this, it was broken and I needed to return it. I did not reorder because o just wasn't impressed with the material or it. I figured if it was broken so easily when it supposed to be sturdy and strong there was no sense and re-ordering it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought this an an everyday carry light to keep in my pocket. This flashlight fills that role nicely. 120 lumens is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding items in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use as a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yards while medium power in excellent for situations where you don't need 120 lumens, such as walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for tasks such as unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe as I don't have much use for it.

The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasions and scrapes to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, as it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it clicks for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on.

Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light makes a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear.

Overall, I would recommend this light for everyday carry use because it is well thought out, built with quality, and above all else it is reliable."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"First pocket knife for our son, who is 11.  It made a great gift when he crossed over into Boy Scouts - he loves it!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This is the third generation of this device and each has been better than the last.  As you lengthen the measuring tape, the measurement displays on screen. Tap a button to save. Or convert measurements quickly (from fractions to decimals, or inches to centimeters, for example) and calculate midpoints (great for helping to hang a picture). And no need to bend the tape when measuring into a cornerjust select the  back of the device as the starting point.

However, I keep wondering what will happen if I drop this on the floor and that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.  I don't want to test that out and have mine malfunction."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Very modern looking and works well for small bathroom.  The sound of the fan is not bad.  Sure you can hear it is running, but it is not obnoxious noise.  I was painting the ceiling on a very cold windy day and there was no cold air blowing back into the bathroom."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,It does the job.  I hope it lasts better than my previous fixture.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"AWESOME !! I'm 6'2"", almost hits knees. Very sturdy,  thick. This will last me forever. Very nice quality."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Works well definetly better than using vice clamps to remove hose clamps
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Perfect for my arrow saw.  I can cut 24 arrows in one minute with perfect 90 degree cuts and no shredding.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Great to have mini file sets, for plastic modeling. Comes with 3 mini file sets. Flat, round, and triangular shaped files. Does a decent job at filing down rough edges or creating even holes."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"When I bought this it was under fifteen dollars, which is very reasonable for any sort of timer light switch product.  I installed it in my bathroom to control the exhaust fan and it works perfectly.  You need to know what you're doing in the junction box because all 4 wires need to be hooked up correctly (and there -must- be a white wire for power,) but it was not difficult and it looks nice along side the other switches."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"My wife and I love them, they came on time and were easy to work with. The remote works very well and has many lighting options."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I can not see why anyone would buy the cheap squares?
I know that I will not be using any of the cheap ones anymore, when you need a line a 9"", you simply put your pencil in the hole at 9"" and make a perfect line.

The people that design these squares did their homework and built a GOOD tool!!!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I'm very happy with this light! I used it to replace out old and outdated porch light. It was very easy to install and it works great! We set it up with a smart bulb so we can use Alexa to turn it off and on.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"It's hard to ""love"" an extension cord. But there's a lot to like about this one. Foremost, it's very flexible - which makes it easy to unwind, stretch out and rewind. Stiff extension cords are the pits. The plug lights up when power is present. Thought of this feature as a gimmick prior to purchase, but it's quite useful. The highly visible yellow color makes the cord easy to find in storage and spot when it's underfoot. Jacket is soft to the touch, but appears durable. Arrived quickly and in good shape. BONUS: It's made in the U. S. of A."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Color is good
Sticks like a bumper sticker so clean your surface first."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I never got this product from this vender.  CT Power Tools informed me within a day or two that the product was out of stock and they were uncertain how soon they might have it, that it was probably going to be a month or two. I canceled the order and resourced it.
I would and probably will do business with this vender again as I very much appreciate their timely responses and honesty."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Looks great and fits well into old standard sink basin. The top does look much larger than the usual bathroom sink drain, so if you don't like that large size, look elsewhere.  My sink wasn't the most cosmetically appealing anyway, so the large drain improves the look considerably. Attached are the before/after pics."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Very Good light! Nice size not to big not to small. Bright, excellent light for the money. Looks like it will last a long time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,You get what you pay for and this should work just fine for its intended purpose.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works better than expected and pockets, lots of pockets bot inside and outside the bucket.  Its a little tight on my homer bucket andi don't know If my bucket is taller than other 5 gallon buckets or Im using it wrong but I have about 4 inches of clearance before reaching the bottom of the bucket and unlike in the photograph.  Yeah, I recommend this to everyone and its even better than the bucket liner I got from the Home D."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Wow, what a great little flashlight that packs a punch.  This thing is way brighter than my LED flashlight with 4 LED's and I love the adjustable spotlight.  It puts out a nice big round spotlight depending how near or far you are."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Is there a reason to NOT love a Mora?
This is just as it appears to be in the photo & stats.
Mora is synonymous with ""consistently great affordable knives"" and this one in particular is no exception.
Because of it's narrow, short blade, and high Scandinavian grind, this basic wood carving knife is perfect for carving.
One of the reasons most wood carving blades are short is for control of the blade, enabling the holder to make precision cuts, and requiring the user to take their time with small cuts, rather than large sweeping ones.
In all other ways, this is a standard Mora knife."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This has to be the all time greatest ladder built, you will not be sorry if you buy it, I would not be caught with out it"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,Don't really hate it. Would give it 3 stars I just read the worst reviews first because of the flaws. If I had longer wrenches this would be ideal. 14 pockets but the wrenches sink in the pockets. Material seems very sturdy to give it a long lasting feeling. Corner edge is to long for regular 17 inch deep tool box but the extra space just folds up. The 5782 was a way better fit for everything.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"This a decent bag. It's the right size for the tools I have. The shoulder strap was what made this the winner over similar bags. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have internal pockets. Otherwise, I am satisfied with this purchase!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is a great quality hole punch at an awesome price!  It does just what it should do--of course don't overload it with paper, but it does about 10 pages very comfortably.  I bought it for random handouts I get in school and want to keep in my binder.  Serves the purpose well.

I would definitely buy this again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Shank on one lock bent during first use!  Otherwise, the locks seemed to work fine.  Easy to program your own combination code and locks feel strong and heavy-duty.  But the shank should not have bent so easily.  In fact, the lock was completely open when we picked up the suitcase from baggage claim at the airport.  There was no other damage to our luggage.  A strong, safe lock should not be able to be bent so easily."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,Lots of light for where you want it without having to wire a light so the convenience factor puts it high on my list. But it seems very cheaply made so I will see how long it lasts.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I use these cause I have to wear long sleeve shirts to climb telephone poles.  Most of the time its too hot and I wear short sleeve shirts and just put these on when I have to climb.  They work great and are better than a shirt cause they are pretty thick and protect against the small splinters..
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"First of all. Its case looks so ugly and cheap that I must warn you i you want to use it in any professional setting or regularly. It looks like an elementary school pen case . Why is it yellow and blue? any aesthetics?

Secondly, while all the parts works fine, it lacks one crucial component for apple stuff repairs: A plastic pryer. The tweezer coming along with it is definitely the worst in its class and useless for prying anything. To have to triangular pryers makes no sense.

On the other hand, the exchangeable screws works find and oiled properly. For this price I would rather buy ifixit toolsets at least it looks better for an Apple product..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is a nice heavy reliable abrasive saw. Good vice, good bearings, good guards. This is a workhorse. For lighter gauge steel cutting I made my own chop saw. Check it out - [."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Best tool ever used for crimping wire ferrules
I love this tool worth the money"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Cool old timey knife. Open easy once adjusted. Came very sharp out of package.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Wow! Very easy to install and easier to program. I bought one to control my front porch lights and after two weeks I decided to buy a second for the rear door.  It comes preset to turn lights on at dusk and off at 11pm.  All you need to do is set the time and your coordinates (table is provided) and you're set! I don't have to come home to a dark house anymore. Quality of the switch seems top notch and it looks very nice installed. Very happy with purchase!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"today helped one of the guys at work put up posts for his fence in the back yard.  i brought this to help with a straight post line.  the area for the posts was not level, in-fact it was lumpy and bumpy.  for he said he will level the yard after the fence is up.  so i folded down the little feetters , turned it on and right away saw the red laser line.  we augered the holes via per the lazer line.  put the posts in the holes and poured the cement.  after the posts were setting, we used another lazer to see how accurate this was.....DEAD ON....  this work buddy has such a straight fence line that his neighbor came over and asked if we could set his posts for his fence.  this is easy to use and no matter what terrane it sits on you will get a perfect straight line.  this really beats using the older lazer level.  since it is made by bosch you can be rest assured that the quality is in the product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,this worked out great and came in handy I am thinking of buying another one later.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Promotional quality, but nice for the price.  Not an item you will use often, so why spend a fortune for the big name brands."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Works great for cleaning out the aquarium, My arm did not get wet at all........and the fish do not seem to be bothered by it......."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,have not installed it yet but it looks like it'll do the job
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Good price, solid construction, and easy to install.  Everything that I needed for the drawers I had been building.  I'd buy them again!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Nice light. It has a projector lens which gives you a wide area to view.  So wide when I standing behind a minivan less than 4 feet, the light covers the top of the roof to the bottom of the bumper.  Very good for vehicle inspection at nite when you are close.  But not very good for distance.  Light fades out at about 7 feet.  As for light output, I wouldn't put it at 2000 lumens."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,They work as advertised.  Instant on and VERY bright.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Before you purchase & then leave a bad review  always read the product description. As stated this is a 10 hour charger that does not include a charging cord. This charger works great with my lithium & standard Stinger batteries. Unlike standard batteries lithium batteries will blink when fully recharged when using this device.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,The item arrived quicker than it was supposed to and performs exactly as it should!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"These Tekton wrench holders are wonderful. They are made of good solid but flexible plastic and will hold most wrench's and spanners. I used them to hold metric and SAE open end, open end ring (combination) and ring spanners and found they tidied up my tool box leaving much more room and making the tools identifiable at a glance. You can cut them to fit and I found a small band saw did the best job but a sharp blade would work as well. I highly recommend these."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"OEM parts for my toilet. As always, Kohler quality and fitment. Combine with flush valve and tank bolts and washer."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Bought this on Amazon back in December. I didn't like this light for about a month. It is somewhat bulky feeling because of the shape of the barrel. After I used it for a while it stopped bothering me.

If you run it constantly, yes it will kill the batteries. However I've found that to be true with all penlights that are bright.

I had this at a lake fishing one night not to long ago. I let someone use it and they dropped it out off their mouth in about 5' of water. It was a man made fishing dock. There was no safe way of getting into the water unless you walked to the other end of the dock then swam all the way back. It was dark and late so I left my &19.99 investment lay at the bottom.

We fished for a few more hours. When we left the light had been submerged for over 2 hours and it was still on. Even still somewhat bright.

So for the light it gives off and the toughness of the light I'm giving it 5 stars.

I could dock it a star for the bulky feeling of the light on your hand but I think the pros outweighs the con in this case.

Now that the price has gone up  I should've went for a long swim that night."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"Cheap quality kit, but great for the price.  It does the job when you aren't a professional doing many many terminations."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Working on computers, I needed a set that was strong enough to take some force while trying to remove embedded screws on laptops. I needed the thin shafts to enable me to reach screws in thin narrow enclosures.  This set has allowed me that, while being comfortable in the hand.  At the same time, I purchased the Wera set (more expensive) similar to this set, and I must say, they work as described. Time will tell of their longevity."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I have the 1/2"" quiet ti max and how that one preformed i had to get its little bro.  ive had this one for about a month now, and this one is quiet, powerful and so light.  i even use it to do my tire rotations every now and then when i wanna give my hand and arm a break. this thing gets into the places my 1/2"" cant. i recommend this to anyone that needs a good solid 3/8"" quiet small and powerful impact."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Bought this and installed it myself....a breeze;  Both my wife & I love this grinder. I believe it would grind up bones as well..
but I won't even try! Have had it almost 20 years now!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Nice lamp, mounted to the wall above plants with a grow bulb. Fits a standard flood light.
Has a mounting hole in the middle, fit a standard drywall screw.
Long cord, but when mounted above door frame needed a extension to get to outlet."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I ordered five for my chandelier. One has two dead filaments and causes power shortage.  The rest are OK. The return of the defected one is pretty straightforward. I ordered another one. I hope the second purchase won't have quality issue.

Overall the light is bright and warm. I gave this 4 star instead of 5 because of the defect experience.

Update 6/13/16
Received the replacement bulb. Now everything are working as they are supposed to.

Update 8/11/17
If anyone is thinking of adding the smart switch with this light bulb, please be aware that this LED does not compatible with Lutron Caseta Dimmer switch. I have added the LUT-MLC load adaptor. And it is still not working with mine."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Ok, a few hours earlier, I reviewed a fan that even had a speaker in it. It really didn't blow much air. So, I get home earlier today and this fan had arrived. So, i charged it all day. I didn't have much in the way of expectations. It doesn't have as many features. Let's see what features it does have, according to the manufacturer...

Features
1X Handheld palm sized portable fan, powered by a rechargeable battery (included) or by the provided micro USB charging cable via computer/notebook, car charger, power bank, 5V wall USB charger, 5v solar charger etc.
3 adjustable speeds plus an LED light on the side, perfect seaming, made of top quality ABS
Highly efficient yet practically quiet; powerful yet energy saving, perfect for your office, dorm, home etc.
Please make sure the battery is placed correctly inside the slot before you turn on the fan.
Best cooling effects can be achieved when you hold it in your hand. Great fan for when you are out and about.

I got home from work tonight and as soon as I saw the fan, I went straight for it. As soon as I turned it on, I immediately felt more are than the other fan on high. It had two more higher settings! And it also has a light, so if your power goes out, you have a fan AND a flashlight! I love this thing already! Five stars for this little powerhouse of a fan! Oh, and it's cheap too! The other fan was $30!

I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion. It in no way influenced my review of this product. If you found this review helpful, please click the helpful button. It's nice to have the feedback  :)"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This is my third one. I lost the other two. I carry it all the time. Very useful. I use the file as a light weight flat head screw driver in a pinch. The plastic tooth pick is a must for me.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,This works only if both parts of pipe are laying flat and buried.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Great throw away brush even though I used it more than once.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Used this to spray over a little tikes slide. Went on great. Used whole can so recommend getting two if you are doing similar projects
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Just what I was looking for, magnets seem to be strong. Looks to be another great product of Klein. Would buy again, in hvac industry so most likely will. would recommend to a friend."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Terrific drop-in solution for my track-lighting fixtures.  The lights are bright and dimmable (no buzzing or flickering!).  Very warm, pleasing warm light color."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,Piece of crap. In high winds tore after 2 days
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,"We put this in when we renovated our kitchen wanting to have the newest neato tech.  It would work fine for a couple months and then go on the fritz, either not responding at all or randomly turning on when nobody was in the room.  I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.  Delta replaced that part, but still, do you expect a $300+ faucet set to break in 3 months?  I'm sure the Delta engineers would love to blame this on faulty install or an inept homeowner, but the fact is the product is not designed to handle anything but perfect conditions, and real life never is."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"My kitchen-sink faucet has a one-point attachment&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moen-7594SRS-Arbor-One-Handle-High-Arc-Pull-Down-Kitchen-Faucet-Spot-Resist-Stainless/dp/B0087AQ0MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moen 7594SRS Arbor One-Handle High Arc Pull Down Kitchen Faucet, Spot Resist Stainless</a>.  I guess that a good deal of torque is applied to the single nut and bolt holding it in place, and it loosens easily, at least when installed without Locktite as my plumber did.  It's almost impossible to get at this nut.  I could feel it in order to hand-tighten it blindly, but I couldn't get it secured.  I thought getting a wrench on it without a special plumber's faucet tool would be impossible.  I was therefore nearly ready to give up and request a service call, that surely would have cost $100, when I saw this product.  It came in 2 days, and my faucet was secured rigidly (pun intended, sorry) in 2.01 days -- a minor miracle from my desperate perspective.
I wish it had multiple inserts for different size nuts because if they're mounted flush, I don't see how it could reach the smaller sizes, as designed with the smaller-sized wrenches nested within and below the largest.  That didn't matter in my case, but it would limit the usefulness somewhat under some circumstances.
Other reviews would lead one to believe that it's too flimsy to be useful, and that's certainly UNtrue.  The construction is plenty strong enough for hand-tightening or loosening, which is all it's designed for and which should almost always be sufficient.  I can see how you might crack or break it if you tried to turn the lower end with a pipe wrench.  The slot, which is the genius-inspired part of this tool, could allow it to deform under that kind of torque, but it's not designed for that use.

Highly recommended; an inexpensive solution to potentially expensive home-maintenance problems."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I love this shower head and my husband does too.  It is my second one.  We bought one for the master and liked how it looked and how it feels.  It feels like gentle rain and after many months I still enjoy my shower every day.  True it doesn't have massage functions but I don't miss that.

The only thing I wish was that I ordered the extra long hose.  In winter I wash the kitty litter box in the bathroom instead of outside and it reaches somewhat while it's sitting on the floor but not long enough.  Not a consideration unless you would be doing the same thing.

Remember!!  Must buy the hose and connector.  Yes, I know it's pricey but it's worth it!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I just received this product, and frankly my expectations were tempered with some of the reviews. But for the money, and so far, I'm quite satisfied with it. It's as bright as the sample images make it seem, and the beam is adjustable. The fit and finish of the case seems solid to me. I cannot comment on durability over the long term, but out of the box, I really have nothing negative to say."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Worked very well at restoring my nail gun's performance.  I will buy again when needed.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought this for a gift. My husband was very happy with it. Nice size, worked as expected. Good price - I looked around and bought here."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"My favorite out of the 1, 2 and 4 led lights.  These things are great.  Battery life is unexpectedly great.  It has lasted on its first batteries (3D's i believe) for over 5 months of moderate use"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I am an elderly handicapped woman and I love this.  Very easy for me to use and I have used it a few times already.  Just put it on the charger - came pre charged and worked immediately.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The design of this faucet is Transitional bordering on Contemporary. The Stainless Steel matches my Decor Range, Kenmore Refrigerator and GE microwave, which is hard to match all of these appliances since every manufacture is a little different.  The pull down is very easy to use and works better than having a separate sprayer.  The faucet is easy to clean and keep cleaned as well.  The installation was very easy and the instructions were good but not great.  I have installed a few faucets so I had a working understanding of what I was doing.  Not sure when manufactures stopped using words to describe how to put things together or install but the pictures didn't make the installation any easier.  The hardest part of installing the faucet was removing the old one but once I removed the garbage disposal and made room to get behind the sink the installation went very smoothly.  Once the old faucet was removed the total installation time was less than a 1/2 hour.  The handle can be installed to the left or the right based on your desire.  We installed on the left and used the old sprayer spot for a soap dispenser."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"these things are more then what you have bargained for. quick, easy, safe, effective and worth their weight in gold"

a great start towards her shooting experience. A great product at a
comfortable price."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,This thing is plastic so don't step on it!  But it does the job so well!  I had to push the magnets down in their little slots so it would stick to the metal register and it works great!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Good rip fence. It actually comes with three thumbscrews. The new model Milwaukee saw uses one thumbscrew, & the old model uses two, so all three are included. I have owned both models, and the one with two thumbscrews works better. The new model I have now has the one thumbscrew that goes in at an angle & tends to turn the rip fence at an angle when tightened. It still works good, the rip fence is great, but the saw itself could have been designed better."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,love the fit. needed for work. this pair is my back up pair.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is my current EDC knife and I just love it.

I have used it for many different things - it cut paper smoothly, right out of the box; I've peeled fruit & veggies with it; opened packages with it; widdled some twigs with it; cut wires; and even pried open a metal lid that was tightly seeled.

It's thumb release is wonderful and makes opening the knife quick and extremely easy. One-handed operation.

It's sturdy, looks good and has a substaintal pocket clip that holds the knife securely in place while not being difficult to remove when needed. It feels good in the hand and I've used it for about a half hour straight when peeling potatoes at one point without any fatigue.

Great item and I'm planning on getting a second as a spare (maybe for the car)."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,This is my 1st inline filter. My TDS reading was 156 ppm before I installed the Woder 10K-Gen 3. After a few weeks of use the reading is 65 ppm. That's better than some spring water.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,"It works as advertised, but the brush is extremely soft and takes more effort to use than I would like.  I guess I just prefer a stiffer brush for my work.  If you have a lighter touch and don't manhandle the brush like I do, it may be a good fit for you.
I had some trouble with the first brush, but the seller was immediately there to try and resolve the issue.  He sent me another brush and assured me that it was a very rare manufacturing anomaly.  He even went so far as to focus on looking to see what may have happened at the manufacturing facility.  I only mention this because if you are even remotely thinking about purchasing this, you can with confidence as the owner/CEO stands firmly behind his invention."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I had to step up to a 3/4"" drive socket to break loose the axle nuts on my car.  I broke a 1/2"" breaker bar so I needed something more serious.  This socket, combined with a 3/4"" breaker bar, did the trick nicely.  It stood up to the abuse of a 48"" long breaker bar with another 2-foot cheater pipe slipped over it, and me jumping on the end of it a couple of times.  No problem!  The socket gripped the nut, didn't slip off or round out the nut."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,After buying shower heads with many adjustments and options; I finally wised up.  This is a simple but good shower head that puts out a good spray.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Convenient for working in cabinets and dark small areas.  Bright light.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"The toilet was making a lot of noise while flushing. I discovered that the similar float unit was leaking. I ordered this part, got it two days later and installed it with no problems. Previously  I had a plumber retrofit all the stop/shutoff valves to the new quarter stop valves. This cost a few hundred dollars, but it is well worth the cost. The old screw turn valves with the spun steel water lines are notorious for leaking after they have been installed  many years and you try and shut them off. The new quarter turn valves eliminate that problem and also come with a high pressure braded steel hose that is easy to disconnect. That made changing this fill valve a snap. I turned off the water at the quarter turn valve, flushed the toilet, got a sponge to dry up any water left in the tank, disconnect the water line, remove the old valve, compare it to the new valve and adjust the height if needed, install the new valve, turn the water on. Check for leaks. DONE!  The new valve works great, and was delivered to my door for about the same price as it would have cost to go to the hardware store."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Cuts perfect and last for an extremely long time. We use Freud exclusively in our shop. Best blades on the market. Only thing I would change would be to make them without the red paint. It sometimes transfers to the material that is being cut and has to be sanded off. On the other hand, the red blades look cool. This 40 tooth cuts better than other brands with 90+ tooth blades."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,OR,This unit works fine and the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would have preferred to purchase the one-button model but it wasn't available at a reasonable price.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This was GREAT!  My son was able to lube all his Rubik's cubes.  Now all teh cubes are speed cubes -- and my husband loves it too!!
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Bought for my daughter's birthday. She put the outfit on her American Girl doll right away and loves it.
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,The price for the tablecover isn't too expensive but that definetly shows in the product. They served their purpose but they were nothing special
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"im glad i bought this toy. it does alot when learning #'s, abc's, shapes. this toy is very helpful. dont leave it on without use because u'll run the batteries down. but very useful and fun!!!! not 2 complicated."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Both of my sons really enjoy this toy. The Cyberex is one of the best parts, but it is also really fun that you can lock a bad guy, or Batman, in to the stomach cage of Cyberex, which is also a great place to store Batman when you are done playing!
When Batman rides on his back, you can push on a button under Cyberex's tail that makes a top part pop up and you can push a button to get red discs to shoot out at the 'bad guys"" which is a big hit with both boys, and is easy enough for even my 3 yr old to work on his own. It springs together nicely after you are done shooting the discs out and stands up without falling over or tipping like some toys do. You can push Cyberex's head down and tilt him up or down, which helps with aiming your shooting discs. We like that the Batman symbol is the end of Cyberex's tail, tying in Batman to the dino looking toy! Over all, it is very well built and has become one of the ""go to"" toys in our household for the boys. We recently had a party and some boys, around the age of 5, were very drawn to it immediately! I like the bright blue coloring with the sliver and gold since it makes it look more robotic. Batman is the perfect size! It is a very fun Batman toy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a gift! We did receive it from Mattel as part of a Rate and Play review but it has been one of the most played with toys we have reviewed!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Nice, relatively easy puzzle for 4-year old.  Does light up in dark!  Very fun"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Puzzles used to be something we did during our vacations at the ocean.  We liked to go in the off season to watch the storms and we'd always have a puzzle to work on.  When I received the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vintage-Vacations-2000-Piece-Puzzle/dp/B006ROJPD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vintage Vacations 2000 Piece Puzzle</a>&nbsp;it brought back memories of these vacations and I was excited to start the puzzle.

First I had to find an open surface that was large enough for the puzzle.  I had hoped our card table would work, but it was too small.  I ended up putting it onto our kitchen table for the time being. As the description states it's 38.5"" x 29.5"", so not a small puzzle by any means.

Upon opening the box I was impressed that all of the pieces were contained in a plastic bag. When I cut it open and dumped them it to the box, I could see the quality of the pieces. These are very solid pieces, that do not bend easily and the edges were clean.

My daughter and I started putting it together the best way we know how, by doing the border first. This meant sorting through 2000 pieces, but it really makes it easier to start.  Once we had the border done we sorted the pieces by color and that is one of the things I really enjoyed about this puzzle. The colors were great! Vibrant, glossy and the different areas were pretty distinguishable.  Within a day we were at least a 1/4 done, two days later it was 1/2 done and by day four it was complete.

I think what I enjoyed most about this puzzle was the time spent sitting with my 18 year old daughter who is so busy these days, that we rarely see each other. She was so interested in it, that I would find her doing it at all hours.

Overall I was impressed with this Ravensburger puzzle and I'd recommend this one or any of their many others. They are great for your family and nice enough for gift giving too."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,works well for an inexpensive toy. We flew through batteries though.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I really like this set. I had REALLY wanted Eris the eagle,and now I got her. Once,I even brought it into the car!!!But it dropped. Not such a good idea. It really looks like an eagle too.(used it for a legend beast once!)The little raven flyer was pretty neat. I think it was among my first chima sets. I like the missiles. I like the detachable cockpit too.it IS a great set."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Love this.  We are doing My Father's World Exploring Countries and Cultures this year for our homeschool and this globe is perfect.  To top it off, this will be a permanent piece in our home even when we're not doing school."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Got if for the in-law, he has fun with it, and its a good party entertainer"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I bought this for my daughter, who is eight years old and interested in robotics. It took about an hour for her to put it together, and she was so proud of her robot when she was done. I liked that it was easy enough for her to build by herself, though she did need a bit of adult assistance to tighten some of the screws. The robot is very cute and it works perfectly. I have since bought her a few other 4M robots as Christmas gifts (which she has not opened yet) because she had so much fun building this one."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This looks exactly like the witch in the Room on the Broom book and DVD!  It has the official tag saying it is a Room on the Broom character!  My grandson will love it for Christmas!
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,Son loved. white changing marker ran out earlier than expected
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I was very surprised by this. It's very sturdy and the quality seems to be better than you would expect for something you paid $14 for. My husband blew it up with his mouth and had no issue. My kids have bounced both indoors and out and its neither showing any signs of wear and tear, nor is it filthy. I would purchase this again for sure."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Our three year old loves this T-REX! Lots of imaginative play! Well made toy and fun!
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,I love all the puzzles by Melissa and Doug!  They're all wooden and well made and my son loves them!
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"I ordered this item assuming it was the Real Bananagrams. I was sent a cheaper ""take-off"" of the real Bananagrams game. There was no trademark for the game on the storage bag - which the original version of the game has. I compared the true Bananagrams at a local toy store and the version I was sold here was a cheaper take-off on the real product. The storage bag was cheap, thin material with lose threads. The true version of this game has a nice quality storage bag with the trademark on the bag.

The instructions actually had words that were spelled incorrectly - funny as this game is about spelling.

Just beware you might receive a cheaper ""take-off"" version of this game when ordering from this supplier.

Disappointing and also dishonnest to sell it this way."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Love these Rescue diecast trucks. They are as described and be a wonderful addition to my collection.
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"I usually buy Ravensburger puzzles, but I liked this vintage seed packets picture so decided to give White Mountain a try seeing as it had good reviews. Sadly, the quality wasn't very good. Lots of hanging chads, ripped backings and pieces which were still joined together. On the corner of one piece, the picture was beginning to lift up off the cardboard. Not traditional shaped puzzle pieces - various angles and sizes throughout the puzzle. The pieces are larger than usual - good for someone with impaired vision. Not that challenging - easily completed in an afternoon. Personally, wouldn't buy again, but a nice picture if you had to buy puzzles with larger pieces."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Hence, some parts not fitting well like elevator, but love the flat screen TV built in for cell phone."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Very cute. Maybe not 100% the quality I wouldve liked, but perfectly acceptable for the price."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I believe I bought this set from Amazon when my son was 3, and it was the best investment I ever made!  If I had known how great these cups were, I'd have bought them at the beginning.  I've tried every brand out there, and these are by far my favorite.  They do not leak if you take the time to tighten them properly, and I give 10 stars to the spillproof parts...all others I've tried are impossible to really clean properly, and you end up having to replace those parts repeatedly if you lose track of a cup and have it get yucky.  I love these cups because all of the portions of the spillproof apparatus come completely apart so you can sterilize all the parts sufficiently before reassembling the cup.  I put the parts in a compartment of my dishwasher and use the sanitize cycle.  My son rides a school bus with me all day, and he was in the habit of slinging his cup of milk to watch the dribbles land on the walls and seats.  This made for a huge stinky mess to clean up.  He would do the same thing on long car trips in my personal vehicle when he was bored.  I'd have little white dots all over my windows and seats.  I bought these cups in the hope that they would *TRULY* be spillproof, as in he would no longer be able to ""sling"" milk from them.  Alas!  He can't do that with these cups!  I LOVE THESE!  I highly recommend them."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"Bought it as a gag gift so I did not expect it to do much, but it broke immediately upon trying to pick something up with it"
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"The doll is very well constructed with nice feeling ""skin"".  Some of them have a slippery feel but this has the nicer feeling skin.  The clothing is very pretty and my 5 year old granddaughter tester loved the way the skirt pops out and gives a different look.  You have to use your hands though to put it back down.

One problem I noticed is that the doll cannot stand up and there is no stand to put it on.  It is also a ""display"" sort of Barbie which has to continue wearing the same clothing so the absence of a stand is confusing.  For the 5 year old it is enough that she is pretty but older girls might want a way to display her."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"Okay first off this is not a LOSi product quality bash review because we all know LOSI makes quality cars. This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else. The cool thing about this car is that it's a hobby grade car which means you can upgrade it with metal parts and better upgrades if you wish. So if your willing to spend the money to do that then by all means buy the car and have fun with it."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I had first seen this toy at a local pharmacy and almost bought it right then after seeing how great it was, but then I decided to purchase it off of Amazon as it was cheaper!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Kid really likes these Smart Toys games - travel and full size.

Pros:
1) A travel game with fairly strong magnets
2) A cute penguin theme

Cons:
1) There is no place to store the unused magnets while the child is trying to figure out a solution - they just fall all over the car floor or lap. What might fix this is to have both sides be magnetic: one side - game board, one side - staging area. And put the game options on harder cardboard that flip out the top and bottom.

2) The solutions. I wish they were somehow hidden or in another section. I've worked with my kid on ""it's not as much fun if you don't figure it out on your own"" but once he figured out that the solutions were in the back - he just spent his time copying the solutions. I don't even know how to address this one - I gave him to toy to entertain him while we were setting up and breaking down camp and for the car, in lieu of a screen, so I couldn't sit there and play with him."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"such a fun card game, so easy to learn, and each game lasts 15 mins.  its a lot of fun watching people play with you as you try to not get the exploding kitten card.  plus there are a lot of cute little  cards that just make you laugh while playing.  again super easy to learn and super fun to play"
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"The worst finger paint! It's incredibly thick and fairly hard to use. But worse, it's so difficult to wash off and (at least temporarily) stained my daughter's hands! I think highly of M+D in general but they should be embarrassed by this."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I was really excited to find this. For years I have been struggling with puzzle storage this is genius. Fits thin or thick wooden puzzles no problem! Keeps them together, organized and helps prevent lost pieces! Must have if your little one loves wooden puzzles wish I would have discovered this years ago!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My daughter received a few dolls for her second birthday, and she likes this one the most.  She prefers teddy bears, and it could be it is very similar to teddy bears; more than the other dolls.  She also likes the magnetic pacifier that comes with it."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My granddaughter does not let the bus out of her site.  I would recommend the Calico Critters for all toddlers.  I started her with them at 2 and she is five now and still plays with all of them.  The house and all the stores you can get makes a great little town for them.
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Great swings, but they did not come with quick clips to attach to swing set.  Make sure you order/purchase those too or you may have some disappointed kiddos at the playset!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Very nice set of pencils, they color beautifully in adult coloring books, especially for very intricate coloring.  However if coloring larger areas, they do take a lot more time to blend so start/stop lines are not visible, but it can be done.  (I'd recommend using Primascolor pencils for coloring books with mermaids, fairies, ect...)

I tested them against Crayola, Prang, Rose Art, and Prismacolor Soft Core Pencils.  They color so much smoother  than the Crayola, Prang, and Rose Art.  They definitely are not a replacement for Prismacolor pencils, they are still a step below them.  The pencils sharpen very nicely just using the Prismacolor Scholar sharpener (it's the green one).  Where as for my Prismas I have to use the black sharpener.

I have the 72 pencil set, about 20 of the colors are very close to each other, almost duplicates even.  It could of easily been a 48-50 pencil set if they rearranged the colors included in the 48 pencil set they offer.  I did purchase the metallic 12pk set as well which I'm waiting to be delivered.  I found a color chart online, and modified it to included which pencils come in the different sets.  I've included the pictures in my review."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Simple mechanics with fast-flowing turns lead to quick games. Two ways to win, and a set of movement options shared by both players throughout play."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Kids enjoyed building the toys, and had minimal frustrations, but there is little fun after the initial build.  It does not necessarily encourage free thinking and creativity nearly as much as other building toys, but it is a good starter set for that type of thinking.  After done, you are kind of stuck with two big toys that don't do much beyond standard toys that are already built.  Not knocking it really, but just how my kids work.  I think at this price, there should be more creative thinking."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"Our seven year old likes it.  It does seem a bit flimsy, though."
Toys_and_Games_5,2,OR,Nice wrap for cheap plastic parts. the stand bearly stands by itself. Would def avoid buying it.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"The Weebles were a bigger hit than I expected with my 2.5 year old granddaughter. I expected my 11 month old grandson to be the one playing with these toys since they are chunky and easy to hold onto. But my granddaughter played with these characters putting them in and out of a Weebles playhouse that I had from long ago. She just kept saying, Weebles wobble but they don't fall down!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Maleficent is another fun figure from the Disney Infinity line.  She has some good, powerful moves and plays well in the toy box.  My little dude is working on leveling her up to see what other moves she has along with unlocking her flying (hopefully) ability.  The figure also really looks like an animated version of Angelina Jolie."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Update: Note that this is an episode 7 version. Revell released a new version (Last Jedi) in 2018. The new model comes only in black & orange paint version and has a pilot & booster (see the pics). The size of the BB-8 unit & sound effects are also slightly different.
---------------------
I've got 6 Star Wars Build & Play models for my 4 Y.O. boy so far. I think this one is one of the first models in the Build & Play series. While all the others I've got have both ""light"" and sound effects, this one (and the other X-Wing with black & orange camo) has sound effects only. The sound effect is also not as cool/laud as some others (TIE fighter sounds the best IMO). Nevertheless, you can't skip this one if your kid wants a Star Wars Build & Play model I guess. One good side of this is that this one has a little higher chance to survive in your kid's hands, compared to the Level 2 X-Wing from Revell. The Level-2 X-Wing lasted a week or so (My son is extremely cautious when handling his toys) before its super thin laser cannons shafts were bent and some parts fall off. I don't see any advantage of buying Level-2 X-Wing over this one. This Level-1 model looks as good as the level-2 X-Wing.

Compared to other Build & Play models, this and the other X-Wings are exactly the same except for the color. The difficulty is on the low side. If you want to introduce this series to your child before the recommended age (8+), this can be a good starting point. You may also want to try TIE Fighter or Millennium Falcon. I wouldn't start with AT-AT though."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,Good toys but they were smaller than I was expecting
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,Only reason i gave it a four star instead of a five star is because the box smelt of ciggeret smoke an the box looked like someome tryed breaking into. (This is rite after the ups guy droped it off to me so i no it wasent a neibor trying to steal.) The dolls seems to be okay. i no my fouryear old will still loveit an be excites but i do wish the packaging wasent so juunky looking
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This is the one you I can say I got my money's worth. My son plays with it alllllll day long. He loves it. The neighbor kids love it. Everyone thinks it's cool.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This wonderful little bus is perfect for youngsters who are approaching school age to get them excited about various school activities like riding the bus. It has quite a variety of phrases and music built in, which you activate by rotating the bus sign to different destinations and swapping out the animals in the driver's seat which you press to play a phrase. It is designed to coordinate with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Learning-Friends-Play-and-Discover-School-Playset/dp/B00JLHVWUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog Learning Friends Play and Discover School Playset</a>&nbsp;which includes different animals that are part of the collection. The bus is very sturdy, with doors that open and a fold-down picnic table. The batteries are already included and installed which is a big plus. I also like the easy connectors used to attach the toy, which make it easier to remove from the box than many kid's toys. Over all, a great toddler toy."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,Cheap quality. Several pieces broken.  Extremely unhappy with this purchase
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My daughter is obsessed with Paw Patrol. She has all of these plush pups and carries them EVERYWHERE we go. Seriously. These pups are pretty small so don't expect a huge stuffed animal. I was a little surprised at the size because of the price, but it's a licensed character so yeah. The size is perfect for my 3 year old though. It fits perfectly in her hands and arms.

Like I said, my daughter takes her pups everywhere and sleeps with them each night. She has had this pup for almost a year and it is still holding up great! She's pretty dirty, but with a little cleaning she looks as good as new. I always spot clean her with a little water. I am impressed with the quality of the materials. I am shocked that they have not gotten holes! This makes the price a little more worth it!

Your child will love this plush pup!

If this review has helped you, please click yes below that is has been helpful!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"You can play this just to have fun, and accidentally ""cheat"" often, or you can be more serious and just try to get a high score. This game is extremely simple to learn, explain, set up, and play. It's color-blind friendly: there are small symbols on each suit to help tell certain colors apart (in the dark, blue and green look similar and sometimes so do white and yellow). It's also very inexpensive compared to other card-based party games."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My daughter had a strawberry shortcake one for her party that we hung it up in her room like a giant poster. We didn't get this for a party we got it for my sons room. He is a super hero fan and I loves it as much as my daughter loves hers.
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Granddaughter, for whom this was purchased to go in her Easter basket, enjoyed it almost as much as her parents. Lol."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,These are really great little binoculars to use with 2-5 year old kids. We have them in several classrooms at the daycare center that I run. They can stand up to repeated ROUGH use and are a nice bright color.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My 3 year old loves this. He is obsessed with vehicles in general and loves puzzles. This is the 3rd Melissa and Doug puzzle we have bought. Sturdy pieces, although the edges can get a bit worn after time. Has its own frame to do the puzzle in which I like. Like the fact that there are more puzzles like this with more pieces for when he gets older."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Great for any homeschooling family or anyone trying to teach their children at home.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Was looking for basic ""bricks"" but saw these and had to give them a try... Well worth it! Each side has a different pattern which stimulates creativity as there is always a new build to find. My kids have fun lining up the patterns in various ways, so bonus they're using geometry without even realizing it!! They take up less space than you'd think too!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Great toy bbought second hand at a kids sale. Only paid $20 well worth it nitnis noisy but my sone loves it. He puts toys inside lots of fun
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,So cute rumbles and rolls. I don't think my son liked it as much as I did.  I thought it was precious.  He liked it good enough.  will probably like it better later after new wears off other Christmas gifts.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"my grandson loves this.............  he plays with it often. gave it to him at 12 months, still playing with it at 18 months. nice little farm animal set, highly recommend it"
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,I received two heart penguins and no circle penguin.  Disappointing as we are also using these to study our shapes.  Otherwise as a toy themselves they are nice.
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Seller shipped quickly, i guess the toys were good for the kids."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Son absolutely loved the costume, wore it 3 days straight before ""officers day off.""  Came with a holster but no toy gun.  Thanks liberals.  Wish they would have replaced it with a walkie talkie or a set of cuffs and just removed the holster."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Mu daughter got 2 packs these for her b-day & was so excited. She didn't get a single duplicate which made her very happy.
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"Very unhappy, package came open and it was meant to be a gift."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My grandson loves this!!! Only thing I didn't like was they couldn't wrap it for me and I thought it would come in one piece but you have to put it together.
Toys_and_Games_5,2,OR,"I sent this to my nephew (10yrs) who REALLY wanted this set for Christmas. He is a Lego fanatic but his family couldn't afford this toy. Well... I got word yesterday that several of the Lego pieces were split & broken in the individual sealed bags! And since they were critical pieces that had to do with the castle structure the toy can't even be used. My nephew was heartbroken since this was his ""big"" gift. One would think for $80.00+ you'd get a little more for your buck. I would NOT recommend this toy to anyone unless the manufacturer gets their quality control shortcomings straightened out. I feel like I threw my money away and disappointed a wonderful little boy at Christmas."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This frog is soft, cuddly, nice size, plus the sweet  eyes will capture your heart.  Good price for the quality."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Beautiful quality toy! My son still plays with this a year later! This is a keeper for years to come!!!
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,I wrote a review b4 but Amazon didn't accept it(I was horribly angry). So it wasn't published. I bought this costume for my 4yro daughter who was In love with it. Me I hated it. It's very shiny like foil. It tore in one day and kept tearing. It was a little big but that's how I wanted so it'll last. I threw it in the trash about 4 months after purchasing it. It really isn't sturdy or tasteful.  Hope you like my review now Amazon. Wish I took a pic of it before I threw it away.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"For the price, I was expecting a smaller box!! To my surprise this is a big Lego set!! Santa knows what he's doing!?"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Exactly as described. Likenthem. Bug as a normal cup. Can use for beverage at a birthday or gathering  or party or fill with candy.
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,Green is so cool. Why would ANYONE want to build on anything other than green?  I guess if you're into naval stuff. But come on! GREEN!  Soylent GREEN is made out of PEOPLE!!!!!
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"A friend and I pulled this out of the box when it arrived to see if we could find a way for adults to use it... I was thinking Fimo decorative beads, and while it will initially be fun and helpful, I don't see an adult using it for long when a small rolling pin can do almost the same thing.

That said, the novelty of it is really fun - both for us as Moms, and for kids, who will undoubtedly will have fun with this for a while.

Comes with findings to make some things once you create your beads, clay (air-dry), tools and the machine."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,these were my grandson he is 7 and had to have them
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Best building block toys ever! We have lincon logs, lego's, mega blocks, plain old blocks, foam blocks and for the most part this items just sit around taking up space. but not the Magna Tiles. My daughter has used her Magna Tiles at least once a day for the past 10 months and that is saying a LOT!  My daughter was not yet 3 when we got them and she closing in on 4 now-she still loves them and build with them daily. We felt it was money well spent (they are pricey) and even invested in two more sets so she could do more elaborate builds. Worth the price. We are finally going go donate our tinker toys, lincoln logs, mega blocks etc. and just keep these-these are all she uses anyway."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Fun toy, hours of fun! Need to get bubble refill!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Smaller than I expected, but still beautiful. Given to a WI native who loves the game, and has never upgraded his board or pegs. With his large hands, these are easier to grab at the top."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Great birthday present for my 4-year-old niece. Good size. Great Price. Shipped fast. Perfect condition.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"To begin with, my grandsons, ages 4 and 6, had already been watching the show and really liked it, so they were more than delighted to get their own Chuggington to play with. The thing I like about this toy is its sturdiness.  If it's one thing I've learned about little boys it's that they are rough on toys, yet they get upset if something breaks.  I sympathize with the person who said the cars fall off the tracks, but my experience has been that unless you pay a lot of money and buy replicas of real trains and anchor the tracks down permanently somewhere, you will have that problem with any toy that runs on tracks.  Also, the set is chunky enough and easy enough to set up to not frustrate small children whose fine motor skills are not that well developed.  Therefore, the toy helps give children confidence that they can do something themselves.  And I think that any toy that lets children use their own imagination when they play is very good.  There are far too many toys out there that don't do that.  Everything is already imagined for the child.  Not only are these toys not helping children, they are downright boring to play with.  I don't believe that most people realize how important it is for children to develop their imaginations.  This is not something frivilous.  It is those who can imaginine new technology, new inventions, and new and better ways of living that bring progress to the world."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My son received both the Stomp Launcher and Stomp Rocket Jr Glow as gifts and he loves both of them. The Stomp Launcher is nice because it doesn't go as high or far so it is a good alternative to outdoor play when it is raining out as it has been here lately. The Stomp Rocket Jr Glow is the one he prefers though because it does go higher and as it has been raining for so long here I closed off the entertainment center and let him play with both in the room with a vaulted ceiling. They are both great, but for different reasons. The Stomp Launcher is a little sturdier, but the step pad is smaller and the cord is shorter so with not as much air the rockets don't go as far but he loves that the rockets look more like a space shuttle style rocket. I suppose if I were to suggest one over the other I would recommend the Stomp Rocket Jr Glow unless you planned to use it inside at all then I would recommend the Stomp Launcher."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"Got for my 5 year old son and Georgie couldn't hear or respond to him. My husband and I had to do it, and it couldn't always underdtand us which was frustrating. The quality of it is good, and it's very cute, just ended up not working out for us."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I have purchased a total of 4 of these Whipple sets.  My son and 2 older daughters each got one and absolutely loved making these creations.  They had so much fun with it that we bought one for their cousin for her birthday, too.  I've got an adorable little pie keychain now to show for it!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Bought this for a costume for my son. He loved it. Very durable and awesome for any cosplay.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My son just loves thomas, so when his train broke we had to find him a new one. Found this one on line and it was exactly like his other one. Ordered it and it arrived on time."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My grandson loves his Cars cars and Mater is a must-have for any child who loves the movie.  He especially loved attaching McQueen and other cars to Mater's tow hook.  I only with the hook was a bit sturdier.
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Cards are great for kids doing yoga poses  on their own, or in a class, as long as they have some background in yoga, or an instructor to help walk them through.  A few of the names of the poses differ from ""traditional"" names I see elsewhere. FYI, There are no instructions for the poses, Just the name and picture, but the pictures are clear and mostly self explanatory."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"The yellow was a bit brighter than I expected, but otherwise AWESOME"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Such a fun toy! We got this for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She loves having a drill set and switching the drill's rotation to screw/unscrew. The case is really cute and I love that it holds everything and has a convenient handle. This offers lots of fun play time!
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My daughter is loving this set. The wood pieces are made well. They're a bit smaller than I expected from the photo, but it's great there are so many different pieces for her to create castles in all sorts of configurations. I got this along with a set of magiclip princess figures so she builds castles for her princesses."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My son loves this! It comes with more stickers than I expected
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"These are tiny.  The product description says ""11/2 inc"", which didn't make much sense to me.  I now realize that it's supposed to say 1 1/2 inches.  They are more like one inch, small enough to pose a choking hazard.  They are too small to be much fun.  The papers they come with are just regular tissue and quickly destroyed.  The box is cardboard packaging, not something to keep them in. My daughters, very into pretend play, don't play with these at all."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Door broke off constantly, at first it was easy to pop back on but now I can't get it on anymore.  Otherwise it's pretty good quality, the figures are nice but my son just uses the castle with his angry birds figures"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My 7 year old grandson loved this. He didn't expect it for his birthday and was so thrilled when he opened it up.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,We have had so much fun with this. We have 3 now. Just wish the bubble stuff was better. The bubble wand works great but hard to find good bubble solution.
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"My son loves paint with water.  These are really cute and have plenty of adorable pictures.  The paint requires a lot of water to actually work, and then the paper just gets way too wet, but they are fine to keep him occupied for a bit."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"My boys are huge Lego builders, but I thought they would enjoy this especially with the motor. My 12.5 year-old said that the directions were very complex yet not detailed enough. As a result, he didn't finish building it. He has built crazy complex Lego sets -- but the instructions there allow even someone like me to have a successful build. My son said the difference is that you had to figure out the orientation of the illustration and then which pieces went where. I'm hoping they will complete the project, but I'm not overly optimistic at this time."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,These balls are okay but not my babies favorite toy by far. She does like the yellow one that lights up.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,My daughter is easily entertained by this brightly colored Jacques the Peacock!!  And then you can flip it and give baby some interest in the black and white pattern as well!
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Adorable toy. Fun and entertaining for young girls. Or boys. Well made and slightly interactive. The doll has movable arms and legs. It is cute and colorful.  As cute as this is, though, I'm not sure I would want to pay the current price of $39.99 for it. I think that is way too much for this toy.

Also, the packaging was a nightmare. I understand the need to protect it during shipping, but this was a bit overkill.
My granddaughter loves it which is the only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 3."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,Very fun but not durable at all.  Falls apart and breaks easily.  We don't play with it long because there isn't much to it but the people are fun to play on our other play sets and the kids enjoy using the launcher.  Definitely not worth full price.
